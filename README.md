# PROJECT GOAL

### This project is designed to Analyse and predict the sentiments of the data which is Scrapped from Top US youtube news channel using Natural Language Processing with Python, FLASK, HTML, SQL.
### A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, vectorization all steps are explained in detail.

# Project Motivation

**The US president has a huge influence on people's lives both at home and abroad, so when the next election is held on 3 November, the outcome will matter to everyone.
This inspired me to take up this project and just to see some insights what will be the reality regarding this Election**

# Requirements Installation
