To the democrats: 

         Doing away with the oil industry? To any democrats reading this, send me your thoughts of why comments like that should be applauded. You want to know something so great about this country? Even though yourself, and many other democrats like you are voting against our great nation, our way of live, and our futures, americans will still accept you after all this. You still will reap the rewards flourished from the American way of life being able to remain standing. And things will get even better in time, trump has great plans and policies that you would know about if you knew what research was. In fact, just this morning he was (and is) working on a peace treaty to unite the Middle East (Sudan, Israel, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and with good hopes, Iran, only if they agree to forfeit nuclear weapons). The Middle East has never been United, they have only waged war against each other for thousands of years, over religion, territory, and trade. The leaders of those countries are very enthusiastic too, what a great thing that would be. Look it up, I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt believe me. None of this ignorance is your fault, I don‚Äôt blame you. I blame the outside influences fueled solely by democrats, they shaped you. I hope one day you realize how wrong you are, and I hope you have a great day, even though we have opposed views, we are both Americans. What a great place to live. "
