Let’s see, I bet you can’t even count how much times he has stuttered. I’m sure trump has stuttered 3-4 times but I’m sure Biden has stuttered over 190. Also he always repeats the same answers for almost every BLM question. He’s obviously hiding that he’s racist, can’t we see that? The only reason he’s acting like he’s not racist is because the election is soon. Biden is hiding the fact he’s going to make this country a slaughter house."

I seriously don't understand how people can rave about Trump when he simply cannot even answer the moderators questions directly, always getting side tracked with irrelevant topics, failing to convey an actual plan for anything. All he can do is attack Joe's family out of despair. Joe may not be perfect, but his answers address a solution to many of the problems this nation faces; however, Trump simply boosts his ego, continuing to not take accountability for ANYTHING. And I have to say, for one to contract the corona virus, and still not learn from his mistakes, truly astonishes me."

To the democrats: 

         Doing away with the oil industry? To any democrats reading this, send me your thoughts of why comments like that should be applauded. You want to know something so great about this country? Even though yourself, and many other democrats like you are voting against our great nation, our way of live, and our futures, americans will still accept you after all this. You still will reap the rewards flourished from the American way of life being able to remain standing. And things will get even better in time, trump has great plans and policies that you would know about if you knew what research was. In fact, just this morning he was (and is) working on a peace treaty to unite the Middle East (Sudan, Israel, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and with good hopes, Iran, only if they agree to forfeit nuclear weapons). The Middle East has never been United, they have only waged war against each other for thousands of years, over religion, territory, and trade. The leaders of those countries are very enthusiastic too, what a great thing that would be. Look it up, I’m sure you don’t believe me. None of this ignorance is your fault, I don’t blame you. I blame the outside influences fueled solely by democrats, they shaped you. I hope one day you realize how wrong you are, and I hope you have a great day, even though we have opposed views, we are both Americans. What a great place to live. "
