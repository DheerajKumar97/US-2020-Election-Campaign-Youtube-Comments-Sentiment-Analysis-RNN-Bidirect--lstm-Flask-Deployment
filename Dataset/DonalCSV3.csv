Their baby powder was pulled from the shelves of stores only after law siuts were filed and won,  as a result, of women diagnosed with cervical cancer. If, I'm not mistaken I believe that the CEO is incarcerated for knowingly adding opiates to their weght loss products/medications. Please correct me if I'm wrong about the name of the company responsible for the opiate scandal, but I'm alnost positive that the baby lotion and powder were products that raised concerns of millions of parents and adults  with no children but also used them.

717,Hovawartfreunde,"""Having good relations with leaders of other countries is important"". Umm. Is that why the US has isolated itself and offended all their allies in the last 4 years? Or is he referring to dictators he has a great relationship with?"

719,Vandelay Industries,Joe Biden convinced anyone who was hesitant in this last debate to vote for Donald Trump.
720,Mr Buzzkill,Trump still gotta get the last word
721,Patrick Tuorto,"For those that still think the US is going down hill ""for whatever reason"" what other country takes their leaders to task on a debate stage like this?    There's nothing more exceptional that indicates a healthy, fully functional republic than a grand ""job interview"" for the position of ""Leader of the Free World"" with it's citizenry being their prospective employers. Do you think Putin or Xi have to do this every four years?"

736,4 REAL,"donald trump goes to sleep at night knowing that he's going to lose to Joe Biden.
The national polls have constantly shown it, and many of his former supporters are confirming that they are abandoning trump.
America should prepare itself for the racism-inspired rioting, and claims of voter fraud, that will follow trump's November 3rd defeat.
trump is, and always has been, a ruthless, sinister businessman, and he came to the president's mansion with absolutely no experience in politics whatsoever, but yet he fantasizes that he's the greatest president ever.😏"

743,Sheri Smith,"He still dozers over moderator.  Plus no solutions just blah, blah."
744,M Glory,"I see no problem pointing out the region the crime or disease came from in a discussion.
Using a politically correct language doesn't automatically make you a non-racist. Mentioning where the criminal or the disease came from doesn't make you a racist, either. 
That is a way to take freedom of speech away from people, the political correctness can be hypocrisy so watch out."
745,Pablo Escobar,Classic Trump is back! Good one.
746,thangi lalnunthangi,Yesss we know Mr.Trump ! he did a good job with foreign policy and he worked hard for his country's  he know how to do/ how to deal anything else he was the best president ever!!  God bless America

753,Nitin,Why Joe looks as if he came right out of the fridge?
754,Skara Caesar,"Trump must be senile.  He said we're learning to live with Covid - 19.  Whilst Biden said we are learning to die with it.  Biden is right.  We are learning to die with the virus like we haven't learned dying before.  Dear god help America and get Trump out of the White House.

He’s trying so hard to “pull at the heartstrings” with covid- because thats ALL he’s got!! 
That being said, he should be in a retirement home or old peoples home."
765,TITILOLA OLAJIDE,Did Trump answer the last question correctly?
766,Michael E.,"She did a solid job. To be fair Chris Wallace was a victim of circumstance. The first debate was going to be choppy because it’s like horses coming out of the gate, both full of adrenaline and anxiousness"
767,Anders Anderson,"Democrats and MSM be like: ""The alleged person Tony Bobulinski is not a real person. He is an invention of the RUSSIANS. This has all the earmarks of a RUSSIAN disinformation campaign. And those alleged cell phones are obviously phony RUSSIAN props. And any alleged information they might allegedly contain and any allegations they make need a thorough three-year investigation by which time everyone will have forgotten all about it. Oh! Look over there! Isn't Trump's hair funny... Th, Th, Th, Th, That's all folks!"""

800,The Alternative Hypothesis,"Right out of the gate. Trump talks about a plan to fast-track a vaccine and distribute it with the military. Biden then says ""Trump has no plan"".

This is the problem of going off a script and not having the brainal ability to modify what you're saying on the fly."

810,Levi Johnson,"Trump, why didn't you nail Biden on when he said, ""If you have trouble deciding to vote between me or Trump, you ain't black"" ? Why didn't you nail Biden on the multiple times he eulogized white supremacists?

Guys, this is not a joke, you are Rome from the 21st century, everything you do will affect your neighborhood... I am your Neighbor, and I want to be yoour friend.

820,Michael Kerns,All in one sentence Biden says I don't look at this like he does as red states and blue states but when you look at the spikes its red states.... I mean... seems like you just made a red state vs blue state argument
821,Michael Hughes,Health care may be a draw. But Trump did a great thing when he cancelled the individual mandate. I actually feared Obama care as an individual did not want health insurance premiums and remain self insured at the age of 80.
822,mathunny jose,"How can Someone says to close Country forever?? Social distance in home , and social distance in business,  and social distance in school ? Where does this space come from?.

While listening others we have to use our own prudance if You have one!!. Others are not better than us. No one knows anything about this pandamic yet . All predictions so far failed. Ha .. Panic?

Where does he get his energy from?? Defending himself. Take away the interrogator-attitude, bring on an actual enlightened attitude, someone who doesn't attack Trump, who doesn't feed him ""bad"" energy, the energy that feeds his ego, take it away and he would drain himself. After watching him for a while, you realise he feeds off defending himself. Take away the attacks and he has no role!"

843,Lawney Malbrough,"Biden would have you believe that an immigrant who is now a fireman or police officer has not applied for citizenship yet. I'm not buying that malarkey. They could not get jobs like that if they are illegal immigrants.

849,Sauron Vile,"I wish it mattered.  Unfortunately they chose someone to moderate the debate who has OPENLY ON VIDEO fed questions to the democrat presidential candidates.  I guess if you  measure Biden's performance with the knowledge that he was fed the questions you might get something out of it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPr-efcFJ1k  My guess is every time he said ""c'mon man"" it was a question he was fed.  I'm a little surprised Biden didn't just look directly into the camera and say ""Hunter did not have sexual realtions with that child!"""

They had all of this planned out before it even happened. They want to have a digital currency where they implant mandatory chips into people. Through this chip they will be able to alter your dna sequence, they will be able to control you. You will lose your God-given Freedoms to live free on this earth. you will no longer be human. They want to create a one-world currency, and a one-world government out of chaos. And for this to happen they want to crash the current economy and dollar, and they want to create chaos, in order to control us.  Please Do Not Take The Corona Virus Vaccine that is Coming. I pray that the American people and people all over the world. wake up. Wake Up. If you know the ingredients inside that vaccine which  will come with a chip, you will never want that to enter your Body. as a human being. Forgive me if I offend you.

Under his tenure, before the pandemic, the lowest unemployment level he achieved is 3.5% in November of 2019, according to the Federal Reserve. Not bad. But, under Calvin Coolidge’s presidency, the unemployment rate dropped to 1.6% in 1926, handily beating Trump’s performance by a respectable spread of 1.9 basis-points.

It's true that separations did occur under Obama but  under extreme circumstances whether that be the parents where being criminally prosecuted, carrying drugs across-the-board or other serious crimes.Trump passed the policy to make them routine and deliberate, criminally prosecuting all border crossers which forced separation from the children and not just in case of serious crime but everyone.

The same people made and released the virus from the Wuhan lab on purpose, to sell the vaccine, which will probably sterilise you, or give you cancer. They are the same people who banned the cure, falsified the hydroxychloroquine study, overdosed the patients, Bill Gates said two hundred billion he will make personally, twenty to one return on investment, on ten billion. Said that on video. He also smiled like a demon as he said the next pandemic will really get their attention this time, pandemic 2 he called it. He's a eugenicist, it's a plan to reduce the population of the world ten to fifteen percent. Best chance scenario you get transverse myelitis as often as it ""may"" save an old person. Moderna, they put ""deliberate release of a coronavirus"" on their patent application. Everyone got side effects immediately in the trials. How is that a candidate? How are any of them?

He may not be a perfect president but he has been criticized by media unreasonably. Media did not spare president  Obama too. But kept it low key. I think Trump is not a failure as a president.But someone needs to put Nancy Pelosi behind bars to ensure  tax payers money is not wasted on instigating impeachment process to achieve her personal agenda. Also Trump speaks unprepared, which is ok..no long winding speeches  unlike reading those cleverly written  rhetoric speeches, that goes on and on,  which is quite boring to listen,although appears perfect and sofesticated."
1339,Steve Hutchinson,I actually thought the debate was a good one 😁. Compared to that abomination that was the first one anyway. I actually enjoyed watching it.

But we have seen since trump comes to power and start a talk, in a different kind of light. Everybody, every nations are taken by surprise here. We have come to seen actually north korea is not really what we perceived as. They people are normal people, farmers, layman people, good people, beautiful people, and beautiful country. They reason why they are listed as terrorist country (by obama administratiom) is because we dun understand them. This is a country that has been ruined by natural disasters and lost its stability internally, and itself is struggling fighting itself over power and food. They are definitely not terrorist. We have seen the human side of kim jong un. And the west is still trying to condemn them. Very unfair, very politicized. Trump has the upperhand here because he started a dialogue and in a different and tender light. This is a guy that is very possible to bring the north and south together. Good job. Hope biden wont come to power here, then its back to the obama style. Very old school style. Come on, what year is it now."
1348,Michael Sh,"My opinion is: apart from these rhetoric and their performances in debates, JUST give another 4 years opportunity to a non politician to act, yes 4 years more does not count in a history of a great nation like US, but president Trump as a business man can show his entire performance in 8 years, and who knows it could be a pattern of success for our country...JUST GIVE HIM ANOTHER 4 YEARS TO DO WHAT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS HAVE NOT CHIVED..."

Trump already says, this is a new one, no one has ever experienced. And important thing is they learnt a lot. So let him finish his job.

Deadweight losses occur when the minimum wage is above the equilibrium point (some people are perfectly willing to be paid $13 an hour and some companies are willing to pay that rate, but because of the minimum wage of $15/hour, they can't do it anymore). This would cause job terminations (the higher the minimum wage, the higher the number of job terminations) and an increased unemployment rate. As different regions have different workforce supply and demand curves, the solution is to define the minimum wage rates with a quantitative formula for those regions, with an absolute lowest bound nationally."

The Trial of John Peter Zenger for Libeling the Colonial Government in 1735 is why we have free speech and free press on this continent, a transcript of the trial, which was a popular little book at the time, was in possession of Thomas Jefferson when drafting the Declaration of Independence and inspired the First Amendment to the Constitution."
