3,PM Narayanan,Is the Mask the Biggest issue that the whole world facing now? - One of the bad interviews i have seen in the recent past
4,Adrian Vicuna,I feel bad for the lady interviewing a president that lies to all of us
5,Danielle O'Brien,The 60 minuets interview that was 20 minuets
6,Keith Nayo,"When she opened that empty book, I couldn't stop laughing😂😂"

10,Ruby,It's impossible to change a sociopath even for a professional chychologist.
11,bekind always,"When he gets up and she says... ""Be careful"" 😲🥴"
12,Sponge L,"""... start politely ..."", so you never blush?!"
13,JeeJeeArtCrafts,"It's truly amazing how he actually believes his own lies - mentally impaired in his perceptions.  I haven't been able to find any semblance of character in him.    His lies, and constant blame and the incredible need to deny realtiy if it is not serving him.  I don't really think he had anything to do with the success of the economy which he inherited from Obama who was the one who brought back the economy from the worst recession since 1929.  And on and on.   Trump is so stuck in his ego image and has done so much damage to this country, the first president to encourage division in stead of unity."
14,,I can’t believe this is real life
15,Nils Kroes,Show the whole interview don’t cut all the good things

28,Emma1996able,"Mike Pence is a real politician, he knows how to speak. Donald Trump has more of a cowboy."
29,Nyc music mix,"The person scrolling down through the comments, have a nice day"
30,morgan higginbotham,they didn't even air the part when mike pence explained why he walked out too
31,spudbeau,So any journalist that asks him a challenging question is 'fake news'? The sad thing is that he believes his own press!
32,Mirgalam Yershat,Interview and the interviewer is definitely anti-Trump minded. What’s the point of giving background info? Bypassing Trump’s arguments?

Ignore negativities from that Bafoon🦧 as he's just a Liar-in-Chief."
47,Heidi,"As much as I love 60 minutes, I thought interviewers/hosts were supposed to be objective.  There is a clear tonal difference between this interview vs Norah with Biden.  Hopefully, we got the ratings we aspired for here bc unfortunately there's been a severe content deficit due to pandemic mayhem - seeing as I've been directly affected/unemployed and I'm here commenting on the last 20 mins and 46 secs + ad time I'll never get back.

“No”"
55,LYNAY LGWAYH,"it sickens me that they say ""you need proof, evidence for us to air this"" while we know there was a fisa warrant. how they say theres no scandal to biden NO proof at all. while we know theres a lot of proof things that link up together, there was little proof in the muller report but that according to 60 minutes is enough proof, theres enough proof in the ukrain impeachment deal but not enough with hunters company recieving billions from the chinese bank on a visit to china the same day on the same flight with Joe. also burisma, you know when a room smells like a cadaver you know somethings wrong even though you dont have the body. its the same Hunter recieving favorable positions and unrealistic deals at the same time his father is VP?

197,Natalie Guerrero,"Shouldn’t he want the harder questions? Wouldn’t it give him more credibility if he was able to answer the hardest questions (in his opinion) that have been asked? And shouldn’t the president be able to answer, or at least try to answer, tough questions since he has the toughest job? What does it say to the American people and the children of American when we watch our president walk away from a situation when it gets tough?"

I felt i was going to be treated like a trash cause i was in another man country. I am grateful to God for the few people i met in USA. I don't know if anyone reading this right now has heard of Lyra Holt Dean, i am not here to promote or advertise her, i feel she is someone we should have to learn one or two things for she has been helpful to me. She brought financial freedom to my life and the life of my family. We will forever be grateful to you ma. after i tested negative for covid i was down financially and she changed my story around and today i have been successful in trading crypto currency. It has never been a loss. if you wish to reach her info@lyraholtdean. com. All praises to Donald Trump i can't thank him enough for his love and kindness towards me even though i am not a citizen of America and i also thank the Government too am really so appreciative . Hopefully i will be back soon SMILES!!!!!"

227,A Z,Basically 20minutes of lying and deceiving
228,Shayla N,"Biden’s interview seemed fair because he doesn’t react to questions on a personal level the way trump does to “challenging” questions. As the president, he should be intelligent enough to respond and explain himself without getting his fragile feelings hurt. Of all people the leader of a country should be capable of  professionalism and maintaining his composure. Not storming out like a child. My grandma in all 90 her years is so ashamed of this man’s “leadership” the past 4 years and I can’t say I’m against her beliefs."

449,World Peace,"Left media like 60 minutes wants viewers doing ever look into positives , or things that matter to Americans. Like cheap energy bills, employment low rates, better quality standards , jobs returning from China to USA , love of country and God. They ignore any facts from trump which may look positive for trump and instead hammer him on his covid , which we know was spread by China CCP government . Trump stopped air travel from China, yet Biden called him a racist,  pelosi encouraged people to eat in China town , but now she says he is responsible for virus spread. Cuomo in new york allowed the virus to spread in nursing homes and causing thousands of people to die , but shows no remorse of accountability.  Trump may sound rough at times but he loves America and Biden loves globalism and helped China to destroy American jobs."
450,Jay Lin,Is this a interview or a interrogation
451,Fnc Adam X,I LOVE USA
452,scavenger,Look how trump answered the question about wearing mask and how Mike pence answered it? This showed how professional Mike pence is

Right now, when most of people have internet in their homes see that most responsible profession like journalist is going down.

Most of that 3 big television network who sympathies with democratics will in near future kills by their own hands leftist influences on whole world. Simplicity will prevail."

I know that other interviewers wouldn’t have done that. Even if they disagreed with him and were democrat, they wouldn’t have had this happened because it’s not about them, it’s about the person they are interviewing. Good day."

482,Angie Figueroa,"This woman is clearly a Biden supported by the way she defended Him.    
Though questions?  Like Trump said “this has been inappropriate questions.”  She has discredit herself! 
What kind of interviews was this????  She bombarded him with accusations and finger pointed!!!    BRAVOOOOO President Trump for  walking out of this trap!      She went in there with the intention to make him look bad and to get him to react to accusations that she herself fabricated!!!"

486,Sergey Zabarin,"I’m no Trump fan but I’m tired of people arguing with him. It offers no insight into what he actually stands for or wants to do. Arguing about his delusion that he’s God’s gift to America ends nowhere and isn’t at all helpful. Just ask questions and fact check him. I praised the Biden-Harris interview as I felt it was fair and balanced and was hoping this would be the same. Instead, she just started to argue with him....I mean I get that he’s not easy to interview, but damn, everyone seems to fall into the trap of challenging his delusion instead of trying to understand it."

498,Bos021,Those questions were even tougher than the last five questions on his cognitive test.
499,Yaman,If you are doing more testing arte the result is more cases. It just tells that there were even more cases that you didnt know about. If you were actually doing good with covid the cases shouldnt rise when doing more testing because there's already more cases per resident than in every other country.
500,F W,"Watch this back to back with the 60 minutes Biden interview, and you get the picture.  The media thinks it's doing the right thing by trying to influence people.  They're too stupid to realize they're having the opposite effect, like they did last time."

As far as calling Trump a liar?? Do you remember Word-for-word EXACTLY what you said, to the ""T"", last week to a coworker? Well.. NO! Everything Leslie said to him was negative. But, let's be fair... Biden WILL NOT be our next president!... Biden will be forced out when you elect him in due to dementia, Pelosi will take the seat until Harris is sworn in.  Lord help us all when everything comes crashing down on your democratic heads! Nobody looks at what Trump has done to help the American people.. they only want to see what the media has painted and put in front of you. He has done MORE in the last 4 years than the last 10 presidents + before him.

871,Photife,"""'MY' justice department"" 🤣🤣🤣"
872,KingintheMountain,The reason Biden didn't get interrupted is because nothing Biden said was objectively incorrect.
873,Aysha a,"I think the Covid remarks were unfair. Cases are up because PEOPLE don't listen... They go out and socialize when they are not supposed to... they don't wear their masks properly or have private parties...  But also, the stress from covid is making people mentally unwell, but also, I personally think a lot of the newer insomnia cases could be from the masks, the fabrics that are processed in chemicals, constantly breathing it makes you sick. Fabric like rayon, spandex and others have toxicity ratings and insomnia is a known but not a commonly recognized side effect. Read your fabric labels just like you read you food labels, if your going to wear a mask all day, make sure it's organic and well made, for your health."

881,siyavash Zar,"Dr siyavash zar 
Biden has never told the truth or taken responsibility for any of his ignorant actions EVER!!!! He has plagiarized & lied from the beginning of time - He said he attended Delaware State U with ""his folks"" - NOT TRUE! He said he graduated College with 3 degrees -  NOT TRUE! He said he graduated Law School in the upper half of his class - NOT TRUE (he graduated 76th out of 85 students! - not too bright). HE plagiarized many others' speeches.  He said he would end Fracking - now he tells PA he won't end fracking (which way is it, Joe, you lying POS?) I could go on and on and on. EVERYTHING (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING) THAT COMES OUT OF THAT MAN'S MOUTH IS A LIE!♥️♥️♥️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
882,The American Fist of Steel,"I will never give a shred of trust to the leftist media.  It doesn't matter if the media is mainstream or social.  They are liars, deceivers and manipulators.  The left is deathly afraid of President Trump because he's a total threat to their tyrannical hold on the hearts and minds of the American people.  We must vote for President Trump because our lives depend on that very vote.  Never trust the left-leaning media, no matter how ""popular"" they are.  Vote for Trump.  Vote for freedom!"
883,Rose Hout,Why did she take her mask off??
884,Jennifer Nunes,The shut downs that equal unemployment ...are mandated by the governors.    Not by the President.   In fact the President is saying open.  Go imagine the California governor is of opposite political party and we have extremely high unemployment    How is the unemployment numbers the presidents  fault????
885,MidNight USA,"Go to lines
“At a level”
“Look at the papers”"
886,Happy Pickle,Hey 60 minutes go get the facts and info the President of the United States is directing you too. If you refuse to change your reporting you make it more difficult on America. A media insisting on such ways makes some people think the media does have a negative genda supporting negative plans..Very disappointing.
887,Gabriel Clarence,I hope the Americans vote wisely for the sake of the World.

893,Miguel Garcia,"The most egregious attack on this President is the Political attack on Corona Pandemic. Our Presidents stance on Corona was the best that could be done. Closing of China, Updating depleted STOCK Pile, developing of Testing and equipment, Updating of treatments pending a vaccine. Developing of a vaccine. All you want to do is attack him when Corrupt Joe could not come close do doing what this President did!!! and would have doomed us even more based on his statement at the beginning. Its obvious what the Media and the Democratic Party is doing!!!"

901,Mila Lyam,"Media has been unfairness and not doing their job investigating Biden family and avoiding asking the hard questions. The media afraid to repeat Clinton mistake with emails coverage. We, the people, want the truth and this is completely fake interview since it’s an attack and not asking President Trump about his policies and his future plans for our country. What was even meant when she said, “ be careful” to President Trump? Stop this hate in the media and start being journalist as you taught to be. Be neutral in your interviews instead of showing your personal interest."

908,M.P 2023,"“I’m kidding.”
“I was joking.” The biggest joke is him. Is he even hearing himself? This guy is truly unbelievably....I don’t have words anymore. This President is just giving us more reasons to stop believing in him and for people to disrespect him. He says he is taking this seriously but it is quite obvious he isn’t. He- I’m done. Absolutely done. She did right. She did right in cutting him off like he does with other people. I’m glad she stood up and clearly showed confusion in what the heck is going on in his head because we can’t understand him at this point."

Well, you should not have wasted the President's time with all your worthless ""gotcha journalism"". According to Trump's raw footage of the interview, the interview ended after at/after 37m:25s which means more than half had been edited out by 60 minutes, anyway. The pathetic Lesley Stahl had plenty of time with Donald Trump to ask whatever questions she wanted but squandered her opportunity. Then again, the "

953,Jonathon Simon,"Lol - 06:50, Trump's Healthcare Plan.  Come-on, its clearly a prop.  They even built-in extra weight.  Who puts a healthcare plan in 2020 on paper in a binder.  The sad part is all his zombie supporters were just eating it up, saying,  ""Yep - there it is - the healthcare plan  he's been talking about - of course it exists - he never disappoints"".  This prop ALONE was enough to clue me in that the document was ""fake"";  wasnt even necessary for Leslie to explain that it was a giant stack of presidential fluff, and no healthcare initiative.  I used to really think Kayle honestly believed what she said - i havent for a log time - and this is just further proof that she is as untrustworthy as her boss.  I know her type - they justify Trump's lack of intelligence, diplomacy,  and leadership skills in the name of saveing the dogma that the GOP represents at all cost."

1058,JG Johnson,Leslie's full of it; a typical establishment hack.  Clearly recall her trying to trip up Richard Clarke when he explained to the incoming Bush Administration that a big terrorist attack was in the works.  Clarke was a criminal investigation analyst appointed by Reagan and he stayed on up until Bush 43 wanted to blame 911 on Iraq.  Clarke walked out on Stahl and it was edited out for the show.

Trump: we have created 11 milion jobs

1096,Tunti Turpaan,"There's not a single country in the world that's been hit with the COVID-19 outbreak and hasn't either had a lot of casualties or taken a massive hit to their economy. Most countries have suffered both. It's a balancing act between two bad choices and there isn't one right solution. Critics will always point their fingers from the sidelines and accuse the leaders of not doing enough of one or the other, but could those people have done any better job themselves? That's doubtful at best."

The stock market beat all records under Obama and during those years grew far more than under Trump. A racist muslim ban, going on rallies every weekend then playing golf since he has been in power, tweeting insults, responding to a pandemic by calling it China Virus, inciting hatred, starting stupid trade wars, insulting allies, insulting military people, starting tweeter wars, having an almost daily FOX ENTERTAINMENT NEWS appearance... NONE of that creates a great economy. He surfed the wave. Actually the economy for some time did well DESPITE him not thanks to him."

They still fail when it comes to being HONEST and TRUE because somewhere along the line, every human knows how to lie and misdirect ... and they ACT on it."

1230,Trin Do cuộc sống Mỹ,Unemployment goes up because of the leftists want people to stay home to collect the stimulus packages. They want to close down business so they can blame on Covid 19. Are they are stupid or it was part of their plan too ? And that it was also CCP’s plan to take Trump down. They view Trump as their enemy and stands between to ruin their plans. The CCP bought out the leftists and the media as well. What’s a shame !

Were you fair to the many thousands who have died, and continue to die, from your poor advice, example, and leadership on the Corona Virus? Also, how fair were you to Chinese or Asian Americans when you referred to the Pandemic as the Kung Flu!?  Or how about Trump ""University""?  How fair were you to those poor souls who were not only conned out of their money but their hopes and dreams?  How about black athletes,  calling them  sons of b_____s for protesting the ongoing killing of mostly unarmed black people by the police?  How ""fair"" were you to them?  Or just how fair have you been even the people you claim to care about: such as those unfortunate rally goers the other night???  Those people were left out in sub-zero weather for hours due to the customary incompetence and neglect of your administration!  About thirty of these people required hospitalization.

Our army is the most powerful in the world, but under Obama as president, we have fallen into the hands of Iranian soldiers, our work in the US is transferred to China and there are many humiliating problems. more must be mentioned. under Obama and the ruling Democratic Party. Just three years after President Trump and the Republican Party, our country becomes a mighty and great country that the whole world must respect. When we travel abroad with US passports, we feel proud of our homeland. If Democrats lead the United States, when we buy a chicken, we have to bring a bag of money to buy the same socialist Venezuela. The Democrats of the United States want to take the American people down the socialist path of slavery to China and let China control Joe Biden and the Democrats bring the country down. I've never believed Democrats. The evidence is clear; Joe Biden and his son used the vice president to threaten the UKRAINE government because of his son and he split the corruption case. Joe biden and his son are Chinese with millions to over billions of dollars. If Joe Biden is elected president, our America will follow the path of socialism and Democrats will only obey China's directives. When our money goes abroad, we lose more money.Joe Biden is currently amnesia and is using his position to corrupt as the leader of several socialist countries."

1467,Attila709,I guess he got tired of lying
1468,Zonia Kelley,When someone gets defensive they usually have something to hide. I think some ppl hear what they want and how they want as well.
1469,kebab REMOVER,"This is basicly the whole interview
Trump:*says a verfiable fact*
Interviewer:this is true BUT that doesnt make trump right"
1470,P N,"okay, but not too tough a question...if it's too tough, you're fake."
1471,Cindy,"Trumps answers are so surface level you dont get any information from his plan. Using lackluster adjectives like ""good"" and ""great"" with no analytical reason is pointless and transparent to those finding unbiased claims. Making lighthearted jokes is one thing but as big as an occupation that is being the President, how can anyone support someone with the maturity level of a fourth grader.  He gives the interviewer an extensive book his ""healthcare plan"" but cant seem to state what his plan is in the interview? Truly unbelievable"
1472,P N,"do you know where he has to paint his face orange?  so when he lies, his facial skin color changes and people can't notice."

1477,Buddy Blazed,Unemployment claims up because of the EDD fraud.. maybe?
1478,P N,those suburban women holding signs say prolife...actually went underground and have their babies extracted.  typical.

The more unfiar enduring battle trump faces, the more compassion from the people will remain united and rally. ""you discredit yourselves"" A lession the media is yet to still understand.

1502,Achintya Nath Sexena,"What does the question ""We have had the pandemic on your watch"" mean? Is Trump responsible for COVID 19?"
1503,Elmer Frejoles,"Bottom line folks here's how popular vote might turn out in the ballot box much like youtube views: Trump 3.8M viewers compared to Biden 2.9M viewers only!  Which will more likely translate to EC of 270 to Trump.  Remember folks winner-takes-all!  You may not like the man, but at least show respect to the office, in which he serves diligently everyday to the country and the American people, who voted for him and will vote for him again into that position for 4 more years...and please don't say Russian collusion/interference again, that's an old unproven news without merit.

1505,Leon Kennedy,Where can I watch a video where she isn't cutting him out and saying he's lieing when he isn't?
1506,H K,Watch the unedited version and youll see the bias
1507,"Marie-Madeleine, E. Jones","Masks DO WORK  -  to weaken your immune system and make you more vulnerable to anything else besides covid.  
They say you can breathe just as well behind a mask, and at the same time, and many people go about demanding that you wear it   ON THE NOSE!   If this is true, then masks aren't useful at all to protect anybody, because if you need it on your nose to protect yourself, and if they let air in while on your nose, then Covid goes in, too and also goes  OUT. So masks don't protect the people wearing them,  NOR OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THEM  :  this is sheer nonsense  in itself  and the argument destroys ITSELF  :  IPSO FACTO.  On the other hand, to top it all, people  DO BREATHE IN AGAIN THEIR  OWN EXPELLED CO2, when they wear a mask all the way above the nose. This is why it is harmful to your health in the long run, especially when wearing it for long hours on end...   Masks might be somewhat useful to prevent droplets coming from your mouth, but are extremely damaging when over the nose..."

1530,Applewood Chickenwood Farm Fun,Shes misleading in this. She was very rude to our President. Here is how she really acted. For instance compare her badgering questions and no matter what he said she was lieing.   Compare his jokingly playing at a rally and her trying to make it sound like he was actually begging them . Unbelievable.  He should have  skipped that tradition. People will only believe this trash version
