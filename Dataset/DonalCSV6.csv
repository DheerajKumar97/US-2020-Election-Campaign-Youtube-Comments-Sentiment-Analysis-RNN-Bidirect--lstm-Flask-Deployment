148,Kizito Lukanga Ndawula,"Let  us carry out a political economic analysis of the two potential presidential candidates and what they stand for.
JOE BIDEN
He is a socialist: By socialism freedom will be removed and a socialist deep state introduced. With his policy, he will create a clean atmosphere by removing fracking and oil which will plunge the American economy into a great depression resulting into riots, looting and poverty. He wants to lock down the entire country because of Covid, which will lead to the collapse of the entire country, which will lead to the introduction of chaos and probably a new order. If you are forcefully locked down for a long time as a country, then you will you not find food and water when the economy is collapsed. To me this is no joke, I believe that when Joe wins, America must collapse. Period"

The politicians in Washington especially the Democrats,who have & will continue to abuse their power for financial personal gain. Are the enemy of every American citizen. When President Donald Trump, said he was going to “drain the swamp” the corrupt politicians in the Democratic Congress/Senate. Created Hatred/Division, against the American citizens. FEAR, has been the Democrats, playbook for the past 3 1/2 years. The truth is, The Corruption the Democrats, have committed against the American citizens. Was in jeopardy of being EXPOSED. Imagine the outrage! It’s no coincidence the corrupt politicians in the Democratic Congress/senate. Did everything possible to cover up their corruption. Not only did they Violate millions of Americans, constitutional rights. They have abused their power. The only way it will stop! We the American citizens, must hold them accountable. There are more Americans, who believe in what a true democracy means. There’s no Division! We are One people, We are One Nation under God! We are One people who believe in Truth. We are One people who won’t give up believing in justice for all. We are One people. The Obama/Biden, administration weakened our Nation, corrupted our democracy.

He has shown the rot, corruption and evil that exists in capital hill and Washington's  ruling class for decades in politics... well done I say... wish him the best... but I doubt ..Them people will not let him win regardless... from day one they tried to get him out... they'll not that happen a second time ...

I am absolutely hooked. I would gladly do it again over and over. If you have never been to a Trump ""Peaceful Demonstration,"" you will not be disappointed.

They are good at creating wars, good at throwing money around, the people's money, of course, never their own, they are good at selling assets cheaply, overpaying for land, etc, tinkering with budgets but never, ever tackle the big picture, the things that ail a country. No vision. Just a production line of following the crowd. Mindful, of course, of those supra national organisations that might have a job for them when the public is sick of them. Then they get to play with the unelected power that they made sure they compounded when they had elected power."

This family has given up their management of all of their businesses, put a stop to growing them to concentrate on making the US the power house that was revered by the whole world. It WAS the epitome of freedom and power that demanded respect for all the right reasons. That is until Obama and Biden got their hands on it. Ever wonder why Obama would ever pick someone who has made blatantly racist comments ever since he got elected, even about Obama himself (look it up and be amazed). It now all makes sense, you need a corrupt politician to pull off what Obama did."

So, vote. If you don't vote, then you have NO right to complain about how things transpire over the next four years. Even if the line is long, vote and KNOW your RIGHTS. Take the time to READ and stop being ignorant. Be INFORMED and learn how your government is supposed to OPERATE. Know your rights. Invoke your RIGHTS. Protect your RIGHTS! Don't let your rights be dismantled. Stop standing by, but become a part of the conversation to inspire change. We've got to protect what was fought for so hard."

698,thinkerly1,"Nine million Americans have COVID. The infection rates in North Dakota and South Dakota are eight times the rate in New York. Trump said, in February, to Bob Woodward, on tape, that COVID was five times more dangerous than ""your aggressive flus"". (We now know that COVID is 30 times more dangerous.) Trump said in February that COVID was an air-borne virus. Yet people still refuse to wear masks. The COVID virion -- virion means the individual COVID virus -- is 0.6 microns in size. The virions are too small to be seen by eye. If someone with the disease breaths in a space, those virions will float in the air where that person has been, possibly for hours. If someone with disease coughs, those virions will be expelled yards away."

746,Marco Kälin,"Never in US history, not even during the Civil War of 1861 to 1865, has the US been so weak and vulnerable as it is today. Donald Trump and his family, who received almost all important posts from Donald Trump, but also the entire Trump administration, all failed miserably. Trump made the allied countries around the world his enemies during his tenure. Trump has made friends with the United States' greatest enemies. Trump did not care about the people who got sick with Covid-19. Trump doesn't care about the Covid-19 fatalities because they can no longer bring him anything. Trump has spread an extremely large number of proven lies. Trump has also lied about his assets and has already billed the US state over US $ 8,000,000 for his expenses. Trump is dumber than a third grade student with his statements. Trump is the president in US history who completely drowned our country! Donald Trump is a complete failure and whoever votes him is just very stupid!"

And here we have a president, elected by we the people, for the people. that is exactly what we have said we wanted, and people still hate him."
836,Michael Harness,Trump said “nobody loves the Bible more than I do”. Why can’t he just say “l love the Bible”. It’s like he has to imply an insult to say something good about himself. Does trump love the Bible more than you do? Same thing with the Abraham Lincoln comment. Insulting every civil rights leader and fighter who died to make America better for African Americans. I don’t think he or his supporters understand it. Rich does not equal smart.

1062,Emily R.,Made me so happy that people stood up for him even corrupted media tried to trash him. We’re people under same constitution for our freedom in great America. We don’t want government tell us what to do what to live our life. We don’t want government tell us to stay home if not we gonna dies from covid19. If I am died I want to died with my freedom on my hand and do anything I want . Live with it and don’t control people shut us down lock us down like in prison. If we’re sick we can take care ourselves. President Trump tried to tell us we can live through he done it. If we shutdown everything we will broke and live in darkness lose everything.we will never have immunity to viruses and we need to go through with it and it will make us stronger. Democrats want control us shutdown country tell us what to do. President Trump tried to fight for our freedom and our Amendment under our constitution. He needs to win big.

Please please come out and vote. If we listen to the leftist media and just surrender in discouragement then we will lose. But if we go out and vote we can win.

Don't kid yourself there are people out there wanting to take his life as they did to both Kennedy's and tried to do to Ronald Reagan who was shot and survived and went on to be one of the best President's we have had to date.

It's not Hunter Bidens labtop. It was dropped off by someone trying to plant dirt on the Bidens to help Trump. Get real. Trumps cons are getting more and more desperate."
1537,Angelina,"Documents prove Trumps never actually been a developer. His father was a developer, and a successful one at that. However, Trump lived off his daddy’s allowance until given two companies to manage then ran both daddy’s company’s into the ground. His dad later gave him $1M  to start his own, he again ran into the ground of which included a casino. The family’s remaining properties kept, he incessantly borrowed against were his daddy’s estates and resort (Maralago). He has been conning people, lenders, and debtors (relinquished $221M), by conning them about being Rich for years which has offered him a job in branding (his name on buildings), movie clip scenes, and his famous reality show as a game show host that he truly is, and now the Presidency he and his entire nepotism family is enriching themselves with, payed for by our hard earned tax dollars with nothing to show it, for America. The only thing Trump is good at is blowing other people’s money! Case in points the money pits at the border served to evade his true family’s earning’s and spending while in office, on the backs of our country."
