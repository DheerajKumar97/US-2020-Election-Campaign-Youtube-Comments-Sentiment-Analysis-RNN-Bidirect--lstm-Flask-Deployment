1,Jose Peixoto,"Here is how a person like Trump got elected:  you give the ameri-cam people nothing but two <thurds to choose from, and <thurds they didn't pick,  but they must pick one of the two, that´s how."
2,J Dizzle,"The village people value money over their own life.... amazing how delusional these people are!
Who was that lady with the big hat! doesn't she know trumps a draft dodger?"
3,maria cronin,I’m so embarrassed and scared for our nation
4,Terry Wilson,Why do people think going bankrupt time after time makes you a good business man.
5,ValensBellator,I kinda wish we’d just turn off all cable news for a few months after voting. Focus on everyday life for a little while.
6,Awolfe Canada,Meanwhile up here in Canada we’re nervous 😩 it’s not going to end well

10,Ryan Elliott,I feel like America is in an altered universe. Whole thing is bizarre.
11,sina mumuta,God bless President Elect and love one another
12,Ray B,"That’s good they are not voting early. After the super speeder events, only God knows what will happen. Like what Tyson said, “If he dies, he dies”."
13,Christopher Woodford,"""I will kiss everyone and we will make America great again!"".......His greatest political weapon is intimacy ?! Lol! 😱"
14,Kelly Evans,Wow! Unreal that these peple dont seem to know what trump is. Sad
15,Francis McCorey,"😂😂😂 am just imagining if trump loses the number of seniors that might die of stroke in the village, and am not wishing for anyone to die but seniors should be kept away from surprises"
16,On Couch Arrest,"It’s really hard to take that women with the “big red hat” on seriously, she looks ridiculous lol"
17,yuhji kuioj,Please tell me this is just a movie where a con man and his goons take over the USA.
18,Mogens Rasmussen,"""The most trusted democratric election system in the world"" ? Trusted by whom and where did she get that information ?"
19,James Buam,Money is not an indication of support the Swamp have access to unlimited amounts of money?
20,Stephen Odell,"The narrator's voice sounds English to me. England, a country where they think the opinion of a news paper editor is important, but here we know that it is only the opinion of one man and he has his program. He has proven to be no better  informed then any one else yet he thinks he is important and tell the rest of us what to think and not giving us the facts to think about. They decide what we hear and it goes by the way of their clouded liens. They have never asked the important question of what is the roll of the press in a free democratic society? There is always some one willing to tell a king what he  thinks the king wants to hear but not the truth. Ours is collectively  called the press. The think that they know the people but run out and get their story then go back to their bar. Polls are an example of this. They spit out who is leading in the polls like an announcer at a race track, he's a head,   now he is behind. Only a fool would make as important decision on a poll. But that is so like them. There is one country who is trying to take over land of all their neighbors, control sea going traffic on  the open sea on one of the most important trade routs, interfere with every country who borders that seas, have a unit of their army monitor  all traffic on the internet, have a law that any one who produces computers or cell phones make them in such a way that they control and spy on any user, they have passed laws that make any thing that they consider an insult liable ti them no matter where they live. They have made predatory loans to small countries who could not possibly pay them back by building ports or offering to build ports or canals then taking them over, or demanding a navy base their. Do we hear any of this from the press? NO! Let some one in a far away country kill their girl friend they go on and on (as the blade runner).  Why do they want to support a foreign who has openly stated the wish to destroy us is beyond me. Don't they realize that they owe their existence to the first Amendment? Do they think that they will have the freedom if we do away with the Constitution? Are thy tiring to kill the goose who laid the golden egg? Did the country in Question give them money? Why do they defend the lawless, the corrupt  politicians?"
21,Mark Kelly,"Trump Farewell Tour

Trump kisses off his base and feels sorry for himself"
22,Kobus Meyer,"Oh how I wish news could be objective again
No wonder people feel like this about Trump."
23,Jay Lin,Don’t believe anything the president says about stimulus checks.
24,Deomnibus Dubitandum,"“There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ’my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.’” ― Issac Asimov"
25,LION HEART TV,This is a election for the history book very super tense. 2020 has been a rough year but we can make it through together.

I felt i was going to be treated like a trash cause i was in another man country. I am grateful to God for the few people i met in USA. I don't know if anyone reading this right now has heard of Lyra Holt Dean, i am not here to promote or advertise her, i feel she is someone we should have to learn one or two things for she has been helpful to me. She brought financial freedom to my life and the life of my family. We will forever be grateful to you ma. after i tested negative for covid i was down financially and she changed my story around and today i have been successful in trading crypto currency. It has never been a loss. if you wish to reach her contact@lyraholtdean. com.

Hopefully i will be back soon SMILES!!!!!"
28,Ian Brown,"I am not American or a US voter, if Trump loses, eventually (I say that as I assume if Trump loses, he will go to Court), will there be trouble? When I say trouble, I mean anything from protests on the streets to these Militia's you see on the news?"
29,Larry Tennant,I don't think his wife will even vote for him!
30,Margaret Alexander,"What a shame, that unified setting, peace and harmony at that senior stage, now depict pending  destruction,  (**messing up of the once known, inviting, socially well intended, chosen, social lives!**) God!

48,Jason Barnes,"America truly is at the greatest crossroads in its history. All eyes on the USA for the next few weeks.

Side note: Love how they ended this documentary. The thumping bassline and then cut to black was really dramatic."
49,Phuoc Duong,Trump and his supporters are crazy cultist. They believe that Trump cares for them. He’s not caring for them and never will because he’s doing it for his best selfish interests.

65,"hey, its Michael again.",Will we ever get back to the media just reporting the news? The Walter Croncrite day's? Unbiased? A divided nation no matter who get's elected. Some media is for Mr. Biden and another outlet is for President Trump. Some on the left and some on the right of politic's.  Would not want to be a journalist in these times. Could lose my job.

80,Don Quijotedelamancha,"""Jesus is essential""...LMAOL"
81,Ch_ Kh,It's all optics and showoffs from a reality TV show host who got elected by chance to be the president of the greatest nation in the world. Americans have come to learn about the importance and danger of the seat of the POTUS if it falls in the hands of people like the current president.
82,Corey Hostetler,These people live in a alternate reality that’s made up. So many lies. They act like covid is getting worse when in reality you basically have a 99 percent chance of surviving it. Furthermore the cdc just recently revealed that hospitals have been counting deaths as covid deaths when in reality they had other terminal illnesses.

106,wellington Paurosi,It's a shame that Trump's opponents have nothing to offer except celebrating the corona virus and hoping it kills as many people as possible so that they could blame it on Trump.  As a black American i have no choice but to vote for the only candidate to try to deliver something tangible for my people and that candidate is Donald Trump

110,Basketball Fan,"I'm not a residence of United States but to be honest all the data that are available through CDC website and many other well known sources state otherwise , if you look the number through an unbiased view and try to block what you've been hearing throughout these months you will come to the conclusion that though we have a virus ( of course there is a virus ) but its not that big of a deal as they making it , in fact if no one informed us about the existence of the virus we hardly have even notice it as all these virus that we live with through out the centuries ."

114,Ms Smortion,"""Never before have we heard a president delegitimise the most democratic election system in the world"".  Who are you people? ""...democratic election"".... you have to be kidding.  The USA is so corrupt, you buy and sell your politicians and the rest of the world just watches as your ""developed"" country goes backward on the social progress index.

126,berracahband,"Medical doctors will confirm that stress lowers your immune system. The more stressed and depressed Americans are, the greater their individual risks of contracting the virus. Acknowledging our great front line doctors and the advancements we have made medically is a good thing. Telling people not to be afraid after pointing out that we have medicine and resources is not the equivalent of telling them to be foolish. It's pointing out that not every coronavirua case is an automatic death sentence (which is what many Americans still believe). Him saying to not be afraid is actually harmful to his campaign because some Americans that support him have lost loved ones."

146,Ginger Golden Allgire,"Very good broadcast. The different sides and yet showing the way of what we-ALL Americans-must deal with going forward to heal the country in the coming years. It will not be easy, nor short term. The bitterness and distrust, along with COVID-19 must go through the grieving process. We have to get through the election results, the anger that is certain to be there just as it was in 2016, and any issues around (hopefully) transition. We have been through an increasingly devastating war these last 4 years. With a trump win, it will begin to look like Syria. With a Biden win, it will take a lot of hard work by ALL Americans. Biden and the government can’t do it by themselves. It is going to take us to work out our differences peacefully, to recreate trust in people and our government, to come together to rebuild the cities torn apart by violence and to join together by open communication to make certain communities don’t have to erupt into violence because people’s voices are not being heard. We need to take some collective deep breaths during the next few months and hope we all return to sanity and deal with the issues most necessary; taking care of each other with no distinctions."

151,MrFatcatscott,This is really unfortunate that people with education are outnumbered by those who are not.  It is appalling to see those less educated group of people armed with guns and calling themselves militia as if they were up for some crucial mission.  They are lacking capabilities to make sound decisions due to their stubbornness and limited mind.  It boils down to this; education is such a precious commodity.
152,Ishmael C,This just goes to show what happens when half of the nation drinks Conman kool-aid.
153,Ricardo Xavier,"If Trumps won again, american constitution allows all states to split off. They should join canada, adopting their system and constitution, without any questions. 4 years transition to allow wealth swap and nationality choice decision."

That happens  so often & for so many things you can't see how the supporters don't see how collectively he is dumpster fire train  wreck & America is the burning mangled tracks left in his rear view."

Teaching their grandchildren to not care about other people, to be selfish, to be bigots and racists, and to be in a blind Trump cult.... basically, to be idiots. 
Omg that guy is shouting “white power”. What a terrible role model. "
175,Aquadisiak,"The Republican Supreme Court rules that ballots that are mailed in even though postmarked before election day will not be counted after election day. Trump fires head of post office and 24 of the top executives and puts in a top donor has head of the post office. In Trump's attempt to slow down the mail to kill votes, He then starts removing mail sorting machines removing postal drop off boxes only allows one drop off ballot box per county and cuts the hours on postal delivery people. As an American we no longer have a democracy we have a rigged ballot system by whoever's in power we are turning into a third world country."
176,whitesky18,"To set the record straight: Our ""democracy"" is NOT the most trusted in the World. You need to look to the Northern European nations for that kind of trust and respect. Our so-called democracy is rated alongside of Venezuela and Zimbabwe, both ruled by strongmen who stay in power by subverting the election process. Nothing to be proud of there..."

Short of having him assassinated the corrupt democrats, FBI and DOJ have used the news media to attack his presidency to remove him from office.    I give credit to American citizens who have not bought into main steam media propaganda such as CNN. I predict that if Trump wins, it will be a landslide victory.   Ironically as it may sound, I fear this may indeed be the end of democracy in the USA if the DNC once again rejects the election results and continue to attack Trump leading to a possible assassination."

Given the differences in this upcoming election, I don't see how the Russ Belt doesn't go to Biden, which would almost guarentee him the victory. Trump no longer has the appeal of an outsider, his faults (ESPECIALLY during this pandemic) have been on full display for 4 years, and he's running against a rather likeable and moderate opponent in Biden. Add in the fact that the turnout is very high, this election looks like a sweep by the left."

451,Michael Lawrence,"I love 4 Corners as an institution of Australian journalism, but this was the worst episode I have ever seen by far. The whole thing was awful, but let me cut to the worst bit: Trump DID NOT refuse to condemn 'right wing militia groups'. There in fact were NO right-wing militia groups at all until Antifa/BLM had been murdering and viscously assaulting people and burning down entire city blocks for several months. Kyle Rittenhouse was not a member of any militia group; earlier that day he was administering first-aid to BLM protestors. He was accosted by a violent mop when he attempted to defend a local business against arson. If he hadn't shot the people accosting him, he may very well have been killed, and did well to defend himself against that. (Imagine, if you will, trying to beat up a 17year-old whose carrying a rifle. What good outcome are you hoping for?) I know these things for certain because I WATCHED THEM HAPPEN with my own eyes. I was frustrated with msm not covering the BLM riots AT ALL, so I watched them on livestream - hours of it - most of it filmed by the protestors themselves. The mop violence I saw was horrendous. I was watching a livestream when a BLM protestor said ""I don't think I can do this anymore"". He'd just seen a local service-station, staffed by two black women, nearly burned down and looted by his fellow protestors. Luckily the police showed up just in time and saved the women. All this has been completely ignored by major media sources in the most appalling way. When Trump talks about 'fake news', he's making a huge understatement. We now live in a time when the complete opposite of reality is often what's reported."

Our army is the most powerful in the world, but under Obama as president, we have fallen into the hands of Iranian soldiers, our work in the US is transferred to China and there are many humiliating problems. more must be mentioned. under Obama and the ruling Democratic Party. Just three years after President Trump and the Republican Party, our country becomes a mighty and great country that the whole world must respect. When we travel abroad with US passports, we feel proud of our homeland. If Democrats lead the United States, when we buy a chicken, we have to bring a bag of money to buy the same socialist Venezuela. The Democrats of the United States want to take the American people down the socialist path of slavery to China and let China control Joe Biden and the Democrats bring the country down. I've never believed Democrats. The evidence is clear; Joe Biden and his son used the vice president to threaten the UKRAINE government because of his son and he split the corruption case. Joe biden and his son are Chinese with millions to over billions of dollars. If Joe Biden is elected president, our America will follow the path of socialism and Democrats will only obey China's directives. When our money goes abroad, we lose more money.Joe Biden is currently amnesia and is using his position to corrupt as the leader of several socialist countries."

524,Benno L77,"That lady owner of the - no doubt sufficiently insured - Kinosha computer business that was destroyed, said she now feels scared in their post protest society... Well African Americans feel that fear everyday because of the unknown possible outcomes when dealing with the police on a daily basis... When people say it should be All Lives Matter when opposing BLM only exposes their bias and unacknowledged privalidge.... All lives do matter but at this present moment there's many instances of taped evidence proving black lives don't seem to matter as much as the rest of the country.... Literal murders if unarmed victims that have almost totally been unaccounted for entirely is a disgrace on the US, especially considering the centuries of diabolical AA history preceding these most recent atrocities... Has anything truly changed for the stolen race forcibly removed from their home nations, held as slaves, widely considered beneath and treated worse than subpar livestock to a present reality that's barely improved... Victims of an economic type slavery of mere existence, where crime flourishes attracting overwhelming levels of police activity, treating them with similar disdain to times past where there literal murder barely raises public outcry let alone being adequately dealt with as the crimes they are going 9 times out of ten having zero consequence for the beyond guilty murderers cause police! The end! They don't own a goddamned thing so why wouldn't they burn it all to the ground... Easy to start again when your business has been damaged not so easy when your killed for merely being present and black.... When all white people call for this injustice to stop, and agree policing needs reorganising federally then All Lives will indeed matter as AA will have been acknowledged to matter just as much.... Lastly imagine computer store owners were being summarily executed by police because of their choice of employment with no consequences despite many may repeated incidents of literal criminal behaviour by police ignored by the majority of society.... Would they still feel like all lives mattered if there's so obviously did not to the rest of the country... You should feel content that they are only pushing back in a very restrained manner considering the issue they're protesting against... Maybe focus on the polices usual heavy handed over reactive response to mostly silent protests using military grade hardware and tactics, one of the key issues they're there trying to change.... Retire you obviously understand present day society as well as people your age gemerally knows about computers.... Computer shop meh! Money laundering front for your massive drug dealing operation... Your ages make it so obvious its a front.... Investigate the true criminals KPD...."

573,Janine De villiers,"You cannot blame Trump for covid. Trump might not be the most liked President, however he could not have stopped the spread of the virus. The virus was already all over the globe. If you have a solution please step up to the plate. You can blame China for the pandemic. The pandemic came from China, and they knowingly allowed the virus to spread globally and infect the entire world. Why don't you put the spot light back on China? If covid hit when Obama was President or if Biden was a President, it would have been the same outcome. Many people would have been infected and many deaths. This is not an American problem, this is a world wide catastrophe. Every human on the planet has been affected, and is suffering. There is no known cure. Unless this pandemic was infact created in a laboratory and this contagion was released intentionally to create a world wide disaster. There may be a cure which is top secret. We as the global citizens want answers. Was this a natural disaster or was it man made? While Trump might not have acted in a way that many wanted him to act, he is the convenient scape goat. How convenient to have a pandemic in the year of elections. It's obvious anyone in his shoes would have this to contend with. There are powers that be that hate him and will use this pandemic to destroy him. One only needs to watch the news. Of course he wants to win. So would Obama or Biden if they were in his shoes. It is obvious Trump or anyone in his situation would be threatened by a global pandemic. The pandemic is still at large. Anyone with a big mouth should come up with a soundproof solution and cure. They should provide a report on the exact origins of this pandemic. To date no country has provided such a report, solution, or cure. While you are gleefully pointing fingers at Trump, look at the four pointing back at you! Instead of waxing lyrical, find out how the pandemic started, provide a solution, and produce a cure. You are as bad as Trump, if you think he is bad. Find out how this pandemic started!!!! Go to China and find out! If Trump is President, or Biden, or Piet Pompies, you must find the cause of the pandemic. If you elect Biden, force him to sign a legal and binding contract forcing him to go to China in person, and not leave one stone unturned until he finds out the truth. That's what his job description should entail. You want Biden, then have him. But will he deliver? Time will tell. And if he doesn't, you have egg on your face. We will see in four years from now. Trump or Biden, Trump or Biden? The villain and the 'savior'. Don't you have anyone else to choose from?"

If he didn't have Covid19 could he have had another less harmful flu strain and let everyone believe it was COVID19?  He recovered too quickly especially for his age and obesity to have had COVID19.  If so, why would he be doing this? Possibly an attempt to show his base he could recover quickly dispelling the suspicions of his less than perfect health?  At the same time he could gain sympathy while demonstrating the COVID19 is overblown thus covering up his incompetence in handling the pandemic."

He has BLOWN his ENTIRE INHERITANCE on BAD BUSINESS DEALS.  He is a HORRIBLE business man.

What kind of a more-on believes the findings of polling 1000 out of millions of people, with possibly a bad hair day at the moment, is going to predict the outcome of an election?  Not me.

Ultra nationalism, aggressive rhetoric, promises of returning national glory and national pride, use the legitimate concerns and fears of the people and amplify them, target areas where unemployment and inequality are higher because people there tend to be more susceptible to anyone ""offering"" a solution, propagate us vs them mentality and try to establish a cult of personality.

We can thank Roger Ailes for that. Trump is a showman/marketer and always will hawk his ""Brand"", which is all he cares about.

The reality is this virus is no more lethal than a cold or flu 150 and 180,000 people have died every year for the last how many decades? ...from cold and flu but none of them ever died from it they only died with it because it tipped them over they're already pre-existing medical conditions and any who died ""without"" a pre-existing condition necessarily had an underlying condition they didn't know about otherwise they wouldn't have died. Or their death was accelerated by the Fear and pandemonium alone and or by iatrogenic over medicalization as a result of the exaggerated medical response of this virus. There is no reason for it to be any more virulent than any other naturally emerging virus. Nature and evolution have viruses to not kill but instead to simply live off the host for long enough to replicate and spread it. The fact of this viruse's high contagiousness is a function of its low lethality as the two are inversely related logically and in fact. The test for the coronavirus is not even accurate and is not even meant to be in place for testing virus infections as per the words of its inventor itself claiming that it can amplify up virus fragments that happened to match already in the patient as a function of a pre-existing condition. All the pandemonium about the case rate is misplaced because cases do not equal deaths. Nobody sees this from a logical critical thinking perspective it's all just rush with the propaganda that started with those agencies who  have a stake in epidemics such as the WHO, biotech and the neuologists who's existence and identities rely on being authoritative about a subject they spent their lives studying but who are unable to stand back like a generalist biologist and see the big picture and put this into perspective in the way that statisticians are able to do but have no credence because they're not epidemiologists or virologists as"

If you have witnessed any Trump rally or rally even without him present, you will see the fervor his and the party supporters.

1099,Dominick Davis,That poor lady with the big hat is so wrong he doesn't love you mam he loves money and power and possibly his daughter oh yeah he loves golf and foreign dictators
1100,Ranaldo Bobsled,"It's like this for me. I thought Trump had zero chance of being put into office but low and behold they put him  in. I was shocked. Hillary didn't belong there either but was the far far better choice. The ""they"" that I speak of are the rich and elite, they select the next POTUS and put said person into office. America's voting system along with government is a sham. Nothing more than a formality to prevent citizen revolt. Our  constitution and government need a complete overhaul because it's outdated and useless. I'd love to explain but there simply isn't enough room here and frankly it would take me a few hours."

1129,Bry B,"To the couple who lost their business: If more people like you actually cared for the people negatively affected by systemic racism, maybe the police would feel a need police differently. If the police were willing to look at their policies, then maybe fewer Americans would die needlessly at the hands of the police. And if fewer people needlessly died, there would be less, (for those who feel it) need to speak for the unrepresented."

1140,Blue Terrace,"Australia has had 905  total covid deaths. Its per capita death rate  is 1/20th of America’s. 

Most of the country has been covid free for months and in the hardest hit city, Melbourne, social distancing and mask wearing have crushed covid with no new infections or deaths in days. Unsurprisingly, the economy hasn’t been as badly hit. "

1153,R L,Whats so funny is these old people all benefited and grew up under the policies of FDR. The largest period of dominant middle class success. They benefited and now they vote to dismantle it all. I guess they got theirs so they feel the rest of us can go blow.
1154,Tasha Hocking,"I don't trust mail in ballots. I think it's a maneuver of the Left and the establishkent to cheat. The government tells you not to mail cash because it isn't secure enough. I bet you don't want to mail yourself a $100 bill and hold your breath. It all sounds very sketchy and is a terrible idea at a heated time like this. We need transparency. They voted during the Spamish flu. , so can we."
1155,Clifford Taylor,This man is not well we haven't had a president in four years
1156,Robert Anna,"A conspicuous absence of dark skin at the villages. Support for Trump is a cover holding firm to your racist beliefs the same way rate religious right do.

1170,Son of the American Revolution,"Crushing hillary and her vile movement in 2016, getting almost 300 judges in across the country, getting rid of NAFTA and implementing the USMCA, getting 3 supreme court justices in, and dominating with unheard of peace deals in the middle east? Yes, yes America believes Trump can defeat the hand picked polls that are only given to democratic strongholds. Trafalgar Group polls have Trump winning everywhere where it counts."
1171,Malte,"I am from Europe and I have always loved America, which is why I was horrified by Trump being elected president. For me it is worse than Hitler, because Hitler was not a Russian agent at least..  This nation lost its self-preservation instinct like the Germans in the 1930s and is a worst threat to itself now."
1172,Bart Biniecki,Yes! Trump 2020

1174,Debbie Menon,BLM/ANTIFA far Left Loonies have Hijacked Democrat Party. Did you see the Violence/Looting in Philly? You want Obama's Violent cities or the Republican peaceful cities? If the Left has any future in this country then this country has no future Left. Does Sleepy Joe even know what the BLM/ANTIFA entails ? Are these Americans ? Seriously? Do you want a peaceful society or a violent one? Trump is strong on Violence funding law enforcement to better protect law abiding citizens.

1186,Gerhard Kutt,So look at American then 2016 and look at America today.   Which was better?   Is it not self evident?  Anyone notice how much importance Trump puts on how he looks rather than the value of his actions and what he says?   Can anyone see though the façade?

1189,mini Trump,Trump 2020!!
1190,Ron Heller,Any thinking person can plot the course of trump's campaign.  Popular vote is out of the question. Electoral college provides more hope.  All things being tight  there opens the door to a contested election. Long ballot tabulations will enable trump to use that delay to enlist the courts. The GOP has actively  loaded the courts with aligned judges. So sneaky  yet effective usurping of AMERICAN WILL.
1191,Arishia,"Matt Schlapp going on about [The Lincoln Project] elite political advisors is rich.
""Fun fact about these two [Matt and Mercedes Schlapp] ordinary working-class victims of the whims of the one percent: they just bought a $3 million home in Alexandria, Virginia, “to go with their weekend retreat” farm. They also made $1 million last year just from Cove Strategies, the lobbying firm they founded in the aughts.

1221,mountain dreamer,"Why? Why? Was the last 4yrs really so bad for our democracy? Stock market breaking records. Protections for the LBTGQ . Record low unemployment.  And a positive look to the future before covid. Energy independence, and more fair trade across the world. More positive relationships with provioulsy unapproachable dictators. And a line drawn with China that was desperately needed. Covid is a world problem and outcome at this point would likely not be much better in Democrat hands. The mainstream media is disgustingly bias and in the pocket of Democratic party and goes to show the doom and gloom. And will never show shortcomings out of there own. A vote for joe is a vote for the beginning of the end of our democracy as we know it. They know it. It will begin another massive string of scandals and sell out of anything we as Americans hold dear.  But dont worry the media will effectively silence all opposition and Americans will love these new demenshia ridden puppeteer controlled president for the 2mths hes in office."

His tax cuts may have spurred economic growth in what has been a continuation of the recovery from the GFC, but it was at the cost of also causing the growth of the national debt to surge. If it appeared to many Americans that the economy was performing well as a result of Trump's 'policies', they need to think of who is going to be paying the cost; they can see who it will be by looking around the dinner table at home-at their chil-dren. Their children and grandchildren will be paying the cost in the form of lower living standards than ordinary people have today, just as people of today are paying the cost in the form of lower living standards than their parents' and grandparents' generations enjoyed as the USA embarked, in 1981, on its disastrous fical path with the national debt growing much faster than the economy."

1496,XYA Rant,"For everyone who believes the “polls are lying,” no. They’re almost certainly reflecting the true public opinion of registered voters, here’s why. 

In 2016, Trump won the electoral college, not the popular vote. Whichever candidate receives the majority in a state, takes ALL of their electoral delegates (even if the candidate only beat their opponent by 1 or 2%). So, Trump won more states, not the voter turnout. The popular vote almost always projects the polls surveyed throughout the months preceding the final election. Hillary Clinton was always 2-5 points ahead of Donald Trump, and this was reflected in the 2016 popular vote. In the coming election, it is almost certain that the current poll numbers will be reflected (to some degree) once again in the popular vote. Does this outlaw the possibility of the polls being wrong? No, however highly unlikely. "

625,Wannabe Teenager,"A taxpayer is a person or organization (such as a company) subject to pay a tax. Modern taxpayers may have an identification number, a reference number issued by a government to citizens or firms.

The term ""taxpayer"" generally characterizes one who pays taxes. A taxpayer is an individual or entity that is obligated to make payments to municipal or government taxation-agencies.[1] Taxes can exist in the form of income taxes and/or property taxes imposed on owners of real property (such as homes and vehicles), along with many other forms. Most adults are taxpayers. Virtually every human being becomes a taxpayer at some point.[citation needed] People may pay taxes when they pay for goods and services which are taxed. The term ""taxpayer"" often refers to the workforce of a country which pays for government systems and projects through taxation. The taxpayers' money becomes part of the public funds, which comprise all money spent or invested by government to satisfy individual or collective needs or to generate future benefits. For tax purposes, business entities are also taxpayers, making their revenues and expenditures subject to taxation."

The attitude of his non concern of the more than 200,000 American Citizen already dead and millions more on the dying list is not fit of an American President. Should Donald Trump be re-elected for another term as the American, President Donald Trump will surely proceed with his desire to make war with China to start the Third World War. Bear in mind the USA also has many enemies and China is also Super Power with Nuclear Arsenals and has a lot of friends. The Arrogant Attitude and Street Tug Mental Culture of Donald Trump is dragging down the USA down the drain of shame. An egoistic Donald Trump is only bringging the US and the World into desruction.

So people being angry at haw governments following the science is justified. But at least Trump has learned the lesson.

That talk about how the Russians know him, I'm sure they do, his sleazy son Hunters been out there collecting bribes on his behalf, Joe is the kind of guy that would sell them nukes under the counter whilst negotiating a test ban treaty."
1030,shotbboy,after watching both debates I can finally say I've switched from Democrat to Republican. Trump might be unlikable but he calls it what it is. especially the line about how he is not a typical politician

I know this is the debate but Biden seems to be more focused on just calling Trump on his Bullshit rather than his plan for the US. 

People do want to make America great again. I just want to side with the person not for all their flaws but more for their ambition to America back on the right track."

I personally see a huge weakness with Biden because on many issues he is either intentionally lying or just has a wishful thinking.
For my example, I will use only two issues: Immigration and Energy. On immigration, he is promising on Day one to restore DACA and provide a path for citizenship for the undocumented alliens. However, he conveniently forgets that any changes to Immigration and Naturalization Act requires Congress approval and even among the moderate Democrats there is no appetite for another Amnesty. The last Amnesty was done by Reagan which is billions years ago in the election timeframe. However, with XX years the pool of the illegal immigrants have pretty much replenished. What is the guarantee that after another amnesty we shall not have more illegal immigrants coming here hoping to get another Amnesty down the road?"

1192,Clint Walker,Good always comes out of bad which is biblical.  Just look at the good that is coming out of the troubled times we are in.  Record number turnouts even before November 3rd.  Trump is such a clown.  I think he actually believes his own lies.  Makes sense though cuz everyone seems to agree he is a sociopath.  That is a definite trait of a sociopath.

1214,Unxpekted,You'd have to be an absolute idiot to not see Biden is a Deep State puppet looking to enforce more Corona1984 authoritarian changes. Probably a Council on Foreign Relations clone. He's clearly been selected and Trump used the verbiage to acknowledge it.

Even this damn moderator is so ridiculously biased, Biden gets to rebut everything and always gets the final world whilst Trump is constantly interrupted. Why are they even pushing Biden? He can barely talk or make it through a sentence. He has no actual plans whatsoever and just tries to appeal to the family by looking into camera and looking warm.

795,Latonia Johnson,"Those names of pharmaceutical companies raises red flags especially J&J and Merderma if the last is spelled correctly.  J&J's baby lotion has been stripped of harmful ingredients that were known to cause health issues including the loss of lives. The lotion doesn't have that famous new born baby smell/scent that was loved by so many ppl including those that have no children. Their baby powder was pulled from the shelves of stores only after law siuts were filed and won,  as a result, of women diagnosed with cervical cancer. If, I'm not mistaken I believe that the CEO is incarcerated for knowingly adding opiates to their weght loss products/medications. Please correct me if I'm wrong about the name of the company responsible for the opiate scandal, but I'm alnost positive that the baby lotion and powder were products that raised concerns of millions of parents and adults  with no children but also used them.

801,Kudo Kurup,"Not sure about the rest, but Trump is right on China. People who read International news will agree on this."
802,M C,"Joe’s got a LOT of back-pedalling to undo the mess trump has created.
If things are ‘just’, it’s going to take at least two electoral cycles to get back to ‘normal’.
If they’re smart, the GOP will take the opportunity to recreate themselves as a competent party to lead a country, not a gang of thieves.  There’s time, no need to rush."
803,Joe Schoolden,Sounds like final question was pre written for  Joe to answer .
804,Skara Caesar,"Trump must be senile.  He said we're learning to live with Covid - 19.  Whilst Biden said we are learning to die with it.  Biden is right.  We are learning to die with the virus like we haven't learned dying before.  Dear god help America and get Trump out of the White House. Biden is debating with a child, Trump is lies and lies all around his entire being."
805,Walter VanSlyke,"It's all about the money. Money was mentioned in almost all questions asked. Biden's taking money from China, Ukraine and Russia, Trump's not paying enough taxes, and We The People are paying the price."

856,Patrick Tuorto,"For those that still think the US is going down hill ""for whatever reason"" what other country takes their leaders to task on a debate stage like this?    There's nothing more exceptional that indicates a healthy, fully functional republic than a grand ""job interview"" for the position of ""Leader of the Free World"" with it's citizenry being their prospective employers. Do you think Putin or Xi have to do this every four years?"
857,PUBIA Nachi,I like D.Trumpht

862,Sauron Vile,"I wish it mattered.  Unfortunately they chose someone to moderate the debate who has OPENLY ON VIDEO fed questions to the democrat presidential candidates.  I guess if you  measure Biden's performance with the knowledge that he was fed the questions you might get something out of it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPr-efcFJ1k  My guess is every time he said ""c'mon man"" it was a question he was fed.  I'm a little surprised Biden didn't just look directly into the camera and say ""Hunter did not have sexual realtions with that child!"""

877,The Alternative Hypothesis,"Right out of the gate. Trump talks about a plan to fast-track a vaccine and distribute it with the military. Biden then says ""Trump has no plan"".

This is the problem of going off a script and not having the brainal ability to modify what you're saying on the fly."
878,Lawney Malbrough,"Biden would have you believe that an immigrant who is now a fireman or police officer has not applied for citizenship yet. I'm not buying that malarkey. They could not get jobs like that if they are illegal immigrants.

891,Sam C,"Trump’s claim that he has had the best economic performance with respect to the lowest unemployment numbers in the history of the United States is FALSE and fraudulent. Under his tenure, before the pandemic, the lowest unemployment level he achieved is 3.5% in November of 2019, according to the Federal Reserve. Not bad. But, under Calvin Coolidge’s presidency, the unemployment rate dropped to 1.6% in 1926, handily beating Trump’s performance by a respectable spread of 1.9 basis-points. Then again, during Eisenhower’s stewardship of the economy, the unemployment level dropped "
892,RAS Allusion,"At minute 65 Joe Biden tells a BEAR FACED LIE. He said NOBODY lost their private insurance as a result of Obamacare.  People, LIKE ME, know full well how much of a LIE Boden told there because our SPOUSAL PLANS were indeed snatched right out from underneath us. Private Plans were indeed stolen from us BY Biden.

He may not be a perfect president but he has been criticized by media unreasonably. Media did not spare president  Obama too. But kept it low key. I think Trump is not a failure as a president.But someone needs to put Nancy Pelosi behind bars to ensure  tax payers money is not wasted on instigating impeachment process to achieve her personal agenda. Also Trump speaks unprepared, which is ok..no long winding speeches  unlike reading those cleverly written  rhetoric speeches, that goes on and on,  which is quite boring to listen,although appears perfect and sofesticated."

It's true that separations did occur under Obama but  under extreme circumstances whether that be the parents where being criminally prosecuted, carrying drugs across-the-board or other serious crimes.Trump passed the policy to make them routine and deliberate, criminally prosecuting all border crossers which forced separation from the children and not just in case of serious crime but everyone.

Also does joe really know the illegal immigration issue here? He really needs to know the law. Very surprise an experience veteran guy say things like this."
975,Jonnis,"It is just insane to see how Trump takes everything out of context, it is horrifying to watch!
Trump claiming Dr. Fauci said to not wear masks, that he said this will go away soon""
That is just wrong!
Dr. Fauci said in the beginning of this virus that ""AT THIS TIME"" there is no need to wear masks, he said ""AT THIS TIME, But this might change quickly"", to claim anything else is just complete lies, just like Trump does on everything, just complete lies!"

982,C Foster,"These are just two dueling families, like the Hatfield and the McCoys. Most people know all of the presidents and vice presidents are related. They both push the same agenda. Two paths to the same destination. Democrats will get us to our demise quicker and Republicans will still get us there too they just like to take the scenic route. After all, they do have a moral facade to uphold. It's for entertainment purposes only folks. It always has been."

1059,James Fraher,"From an A political perspective and someone who lives outside the US, I seen this as a far better debate than previous. It gave a real insight of both candidates. Though it was interesting to see one answered the question asked and the other warped the question and spoke on what he wanted to speak on. One used facts and figures (whether they are right or wrong) and  made some rhetoric statements that evoked emotion to the people watching. One promoted unity and the other was more divisive. It's going to be an interesting few weeks. Best of luck all👍"

But Trump still managed to go on and on with his lies and utter rubbish, talking and trying to hog the time for as long possible after the two minute section was up. I really wish they weren’t allowed to mud sling, stick to policy and facts. Personal attacks are so low bar.

But we have seen since trump comes to power and start a talk, in a different kind of light. Everybody, every nations are taken by surprise here. We have come to seen actually north korea is not really what we perceived as. They people are normal people, farmers, layman people, good people, beautiful people, and beautiful country. They reason why they are listed as terrorist country (by obama administratiom) is because we dun understand them. This is a country that has been ruined by natural disasters and lost its stability internally, and itself is struggling fighting itself over power and food. They are definitely not terrorist. We have seen the human side of kim jong un. And the west is still trying to condemn them. Very unfair, very politicized. Trump has the upperhand here because he started a dialogue and in a different and tender light. This is a guy that is very possible to bring the north and south together. Good job. Hope biden wont come to power here, then its back to the obama style. Very old school style. Come on, what year is it now."

Trump already says, this is a new one, no one has ever experienced. And important thing is they learnt a lot. So let him finish his job.

1382,xsvrrx,wow trump actually used a real fact on the windmill/solor killing birds issue
1383,roy cardoso,"This was the very best moderator I ever seen, the imposed discipline was really effective and also pretty much smooth. President Donald Trump had many important arguments to defend while Joe Biden prooved once again that He has no strenght or capacity to became the next president of the United States. You may not like the Trump style but Biden river He will fall."

1387,Braines 4hire,"I live in Boston, and it sucks remotely and the children are not learning. To many distractions and I am learning that children are connecting with social media apps while in class so they aren't really paying attention to their teacher, my niece is in high school is now declining in her work load of studies, my nephew forgets to log in for class and after awhile the instructor won't let you in. It is very challenging as I am in college myself studying nursing and it seems that this pandemic is starting to not only be an excuse but a reason of why things are failing. We have a deaf interpreter in my skill class, and she just moved here from NY and she said that it is a ghost town in brooklyn, queens and other popular areas in NY. Trump is right, people are moving out but where can we go? i think we have to stay and fight it! but, I also understand how eviction is happening now and people are resorting more affordable cities. uggh, I hope this ends soon! but thanks trump for putting us in the predicament."
1388,tia nigam,"who build the cages, joe
i died laughing"
1389,Rowan Casey,"One thing I disagree with Trump on is vaccines. The same people made and released the virus from the Wuhan lab on purpose, to sell the vaccine, which will probably sterilise you, or give you cancer. They are the same people who banned the cure, falsified the hydroxychloroquine study, overdosed the patients, Bill Gates said two hundred billion he will make personally, twenty to one return on investment, on ten billion. Said that on video. He also smiled like a demon as he said the next pandemic will really get their attention this time, pandemic 2 he called it. He's a eugenicist, it's a plan to reduce the population of the world ten to fifteen percent. Best chance scenario you get transverse myelitis as often as it ""may"" save an old person. Moderna, they put ""deliberate release of a coronavirus"" on their patent application. Everyone got side effects immediately in the trials. How is that a candidate? How are any of them? Anyone who comes near me with a needle, I'll snap their neck in self defence."

1419,5cats 2kids,If you’re going to raise the minimum wage to $15 then those who have worked and spent time and money to be where they are currently should be raised also.

1461,Putu Merta Yasa,"If the minimum wage is below the equilibrium point of the workforce supple/demand curves, we'll have no problem. Deadweight losses occur when the minimum wage is above the equilibrium point (some people are perfectly willing to be paid $13 an hour and some companies are willing to pay that rate, but because of the minimum wage of $15/hour, they can't do it anymore). This would cause job terminations (the higher the minimum wage, the higher the number of job terminations) and an increased unemployment rate. As different regions have different workforce supply and demand curves, the solution is to define the minimum wage rates with a quantitative formula for those regions, with an absolute lowest bound nationally."

Of all the debates, words, accusations, falsehoods ever in the history of America, this is the race to the worst moment ever. Remember that in the ballot box.  Do you want a man who would go that low and not as Michelle said - ""go high"" and take the high road? Disgusting egregious and reprehensible. [BTW - He did it in debate one and now his handlers told him to go low again]. It just kept going with Joke Joes lies and slander.

1556,Robert Masi,"Yeah this moderator was slightly better than
Chris Wallace, but clearly, she did give the
edge to Biden - not cutting him off quickly
in his response as she did with President Trump."
1557,Zarah McIntosh,"Lame moderator is either ignorant of facts and history or is flat out lying to protect Biden. Either way she's unfit to moderate.  Where are the follow up questions to get Biden to even answer questions specifically?  3-4 back to back specific questions for Trump and barely anything for Biden? What plan, Joe?
He says he's not banning fracking and she doesn't ask him anything about it?!?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?! HE CLAIMED IT MANY, MANY TIMES ON VIDEO! She's a TOTAL CROCK."
1558,Survival,"Well said mr. Trump. No shot down the country. It’s all about the inmune system. Healthy people can’t be on quarantine. Vote blue and you will be shot down. Trump is very inform about the virus. Only unhealthy people are in risk. Only them. Compare to Biden, he is saying stupid things not base in science."

1561,Michael Sh,"My opinion is: apart from these rhetoric and their performances in debates, JUST give another 4 years opportunity to a non politician to act, yes 4 years more does not count in a history of a great nation like US, but president Trump as a business man can show his entire performance in 8 years, and who knows it could be a pattern of success for our country...JUST GIVE HIM ANOTHER 4 YEARS TO DO WHAT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS HAVE NOT CHIVED..."

It would rank as the worst joke in human history, and shows the president has a really sick mind. In the worst and poorest possible taste. It shows he is not worthy of the office.  Not funny!"

One should not let his personal opinion stand in the way of professionalism, even if that opinion is sound and well-informed.

270,Ms. Loving,"Precious one, calling on Jesus as our loving Savior and Lord is the right way to pray. I learned that our Lord simply desires prayer that begins and ends with humility (Matthew 6:5). He invites us into an intimate exchange through which He promises to listen (v. 6). He never requires fancy or memorized words or phrases (v. 7). He assures us that prayer is a gift, an opportunity to honor His majesty (vv. 9–10), to display our confidence in His provision (v. 11), and to affirm our security in His forgiveness and guidance (vv. 12–13).

I felt i was going to be treated like a trash cause i was in another man country. I am grateful to God for the few people i met in USA. I don't know if anyone reading this right now has heard of Lyra Holt Dean, i am not here to promote or advertise her, i feel she is someone we should have to learn one or two things for she has been helpful to me. She brought financial freedom to my life and the life of my family. We will forever be grateful to you ma. after i tested negative for covid i was down financially and she changed my story around and today i have been successful in trading crypto currency. It has never been a loss. if you wish to reach her info@lyraholtdean. com.

They are definitely fake news and bias against Republicans and President Trump. Leslie Stahl was aggressive, divisive, argumentative and she lied about his rally's, suburban women (Which I am and don't feel the way she is saying), she was wrong about the pandemic. She tried everything she could to try to catch him in something instead of being respective of our President and praising him for the wonderful things he has done for the country! She never said anything good! Everything was bad and dark and she lied with the quotes she talked about! I once loved watching Leslie, but all she wanted to do was argue with the President instead of saying to him, ""Thank you for all you have done for the Country""! She wanted to try to make President Trump look bad, this was her opportunity and truthfully she looked horrible! I will never ever ever watch her again or 60 Minutes! So sad and I used to love this show, but its in the toilet! Horrible people! I question why in the first place I ever liked them! Trump is the actual American! The savior for our Country!"

502,Spritvio,"I can see things from both sides honestly there were some moments I thought Trump could have handled things better and there were some moments where I caught the old lady doing some questionable things like how she handled that Michigan government bit. 1. No, there's a difference between criticism and going after someone. 2. No, he didn't say ""lock her up,"" he said ""lock THEM up"" because that's what he said she was doing to her state. You just showed a clip of him saying that........."

And they will blame everyone but themselves for the division, for in their minds you are the dissenter for not having joined their cult already. They bring the division and blame you for the division; for the only unity they accept is under their cult-like ideology, their worldview, their Weltanschauung. Ask any of the rioters, any of the antifas. They'll answer you honestly. They'll tell you that if they get into power, they will eradicate everyone who was not with them. Neutrality does not exist in their world. Only for them, or against them. They are the fascists, and you Mrs Stahl, are doing their job for them with these allegations."

574,Chris Bailey,"60 Minutes have edited this (obviously) but one of the more interesting choices is at 13:40, where Trump says of Biden ""He's in the midst of a scandal"" and Stahl replies, ""He's not"".    In the seconds preceding this, Donald Trump said ""he's in the midst of a scandal, his family are corrupt, he's a corrupt politician, and he's walking with an ice cream...""  There's a lot missing from this interview and some of what is missing doesn't show the journalist in the best of lights.  "
575,dorothysfriend,"Oh Lesley, you are sooooo patient. This guy is a petulant over sized child, as Cohen said, when he says someone is doing something illegal, that's what HE is doing, it's true too, you only have to read report after report. He is up to his chin in Russian deals, has a secret bank account in China so he panders to them. As for Pence, he reminds me of a blank piece of paper, whatever you write on it, he says."

585,Gino Johnson,Why can’t the media be fair... no problem with asking tough questions for the president but do the same on the other side... this censorship is no freedom. They want to control the narrative. Think for yourself. If they let you or wanted you to think for yourself they would trust you to make the right decision but they don’t. They won’t to control your decision for you. America is the home of the free and it’s becoming less and less of that everyday

After all the trashtalk he and Kim agreed to wait on a Democrat before testing any missiles that can reach the USA again, with more time he will even agree with Iran on a deal to wait on a Democrat before doing anything stupid or agree on a better deal for both if possible even after Soleimani. Trump=Peace! Biden=Risky! Trump is not mental ill as Biden claims, moreover he is a genius, Biden will not be able to stop fireworks out of NK!

716,Erin S. Bailey,"I am grateful that Trump put out the things you cut because what became evident to me there was you were hiding your ""sins"" in the editing and playing up his.  This is dishonest and downright unAmerican (in the noble sense of the word, not what might be termed current American behavior) to do this as fair and unbiased interviews with both candidates.  I would love to see the same pre-editing footage with Biden.  He was not being chided like a schoolboy and interrupted repeatedly-- in fact what I took away from that is not how great or not that Trump is, but how vain and lying you were and your editors.  I will chide you-- you did not give the office holder the respect the office demands.   I do not mean asking tough questions, I mean not interrupting him all the time and not listening to the man but just responding to his ""America is great, everything is great"" rhetoric which always comes first with him before he makes his point.  I do not particularly like his speeches, but I do want to hear what comes at the end when he gets to the point.  I think he came out ahead of you in courtesy, even though you left out his courtesy from the finished product and instead showed his final decision that enough was enough as if it came in response to the edited version of your behavior much earlier than it did in real time.  Despicable."

For any person on this planet, imagine an interview where the boss heard something he didn't like and grilled you on that one thing during the whole interview and never got to know what you were about.. this is what Lesley did to Trump.  As far as calling Trump a liar?? Do you remember Word-for-word EXACTLY what you said, to the ""T"", last week to a coworker? Well.. NO! Everything Lesley said to him was negative. But, let's be fair... Biden WILL NOT be our next president!... Biden will be forced out when you elect him in due to dementia, Pelosi will take the seat until Harris is sworn in.  Lord help us all when everything comes crashing down on your democratic heads! Nobody looks at what Trump has done to help the American people.. they only want to see what the media has painted and put in front of you. He has done MORE in the last 4 years than the last 10 presidents + before him.  Wait till the democrats take out the oil industry and you can't drive your cars anymore because you can't afford to buy the electric cars that run your electric bill up, or cars that won't run because a tornado has come through and taken out the towns electric poles and wires.

844,Pat Riarchy,So super dooper Lesley doesn't know about the phony dosier that Clinton paid for and how it was used to get FISA warrants to spy on Carter Page. Wow. Pretty stupid really. She also didn't know about the record numbers President Trump created and she blames him for COVD wrecking the economy.She also doesn't seem to kknow that President Trump has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
845,Asadullah Beg,"Trump didn't cause Corona virus. The media goes on almost as though he's responsible for it.  It's easy to critique Trump saying this should've been done and that should've been done.  Had Biden been in Trump's situation which he was for the previous SARS virus, there would be 10 times as many people dead.  Obama and Biden were just lucky the previous virus was not as infectious or deadly as this one.  The media has it against Trump because their polls were so wrong in 2016 and Trump called them fake news.  But they are fake. They were laughing and making fun of Trump saying he would never win against Hillary. They were so wrong because their polls were in fact fake. The way they consistently bashed Trump and projected him as obviously impeachable all the time, but then the democrats couldn't find anything substantial to impeach Trump. So, again the media reporting on assumed impeachment of Trump was definitely fake -- the bias has become too clear to every intelligent person.  I've cut out all mainstream media channels and unsubscribed from cable TV. I no more listen to mainstream media, they sicken me.  It was the right thing for Trump to walk out.  In fact, with this kind of media, Trump should not have even given them an interview in the first place, because they just use it as a public bashing forum always using the national tragedy of COVID-19 as a weapon.  In fact, the media and democrats are very happy we're suffering from COVID-19 because that is the main weapon they now have against Trump.  They don't really give a hoot about the American people, because they'd rather we suffer but they keep their weapon against Trump.  Ask the left if they'd like to see no COVID-19 with a re-elected Trump vs our COVID suffering and a defeated Trump.  They would definitely choose the latter due to their hatred of Trump.  How shameful and cynical are the media and the democrats to use a national tragedy as their God sent weapon against Trump.  I used to vote democrat (I voted for Hillary in 2016) and watched mainstream media, but in the last four years I've come to doubt and now loathe the mainstream media.  So, now I've voted for Trump.  The mainstream media's Trump bashing and especially their opportunistic use of COVID as a bashing weapon have convinced me to vote for Trump, and this is the case with many people. Too much unfair one sided bashing is actually having the opposite effect.  Trump is right. They're discrediting themselves.  Finally, a much better strategy to deal with COVID may have been to only have strict protection for vulnerable people (elders and immune compromised people), but allow the minimally vulnerable population to continue the economy. By now enough herd immunity would've developed so that they virus could have largely died out with no more people to infect.  The idea is to only keep vulnerable people highly protected and isolated but allow the general population to develop herd immunity."
846,Grace Bishoff,i'm only watching this for my AP Gov class. I hate Trump and he didn't answer any of the questions. If I fail my class I blame him.

He’s right she’s negative and she didn’t show any respect to VP Pence either. Those weren’t questions, she wanted to repeat nonsense and was combative. Retire already. Regarding the Democrats I’m sick of them selling out this country to China. It started with Bill Clinton. The Democrats are OK with killing babies but support letting criminals destroy the cities. Joe Biden is 78 - old. He’s done nothing in his 47 years, except milk the political clock. Kamala Harris is not qualified to run this country if he dies in office. I’d take Pence over her any day!"

Leslie Stahl was incredibly fair in this quarter segment of a whole episode and even her voice overs were a bit pro-Trump, almost looking for truth in this pathological liar’s fantasy world. Obviously Trump had the questions in advance, and he just doesn’t have answers, which is especially apparent these past 10 months."
907,Angie Wooten-Achstetter,TRUMP 2020!!!
908,Cheryl Millard,"Trump is a very influential person to his supporters, so when he mocks the officials, tries to discredit Fauci and others who are experts in the field of epidemiology by deliberately taking them out of context, his hot box joyride during his infectious stage, as well as setting a precedent where he blatantly refuses to follow all aspects of CDC protocol from wearing masks to social distancing, etc,  during his rallies to white house events, etc, then yes, he can be held responsible simply because of the perceived power the supporters who follow his example and have of him. Trump has deliberately flouted science, social distancing and made a mockery of masks, refusing to wear a mask in situations where it was deemed necessary by hospital authorities and medical consultants. We are on our second White-house outbreak, will this administration ever learn?~~~~~~~~"

I'm a liberal atheist, and I'm well aware that he's evangelical and strongly conservative, but, him as president would not nearly be the nightmare that we have had to put up with under Trump. Pence at least seems to understand what it means to act as a politician. Trump is a circus act with sever debilitating psychological problems, principally, Narcissistic Personality Disorder. He is a demagogue who got into office primarily because of his popularity as a reality television star, the fact that the american people had not yet become inoculated against his uncommon flavor of rhetoric, and Russian interference. Pence is an intensely vanilla conservative. But he lacks the amoralism that trump has used to do the damage he has done."
931,Andrew James,"Trump has been doing a good job truly speaking, 5 months ago i was in the united states of America and i was infected with covid19 i and i thought i was going to die, but the hospitality, love, care and kindness i received was one of a kind. I felt i was going to be treated like a trash cause i was in another man country. I am grateful to God for the few people i met in USA. I don't know if anyone reading this right now has heard of Lyra Holt Dean, i am not here to promote or advertise her, i feel she is someone we should have to learn one or two things for she has been helpful to me. She brought financial freedom to my life and the life of my family. We will forever be grateful to you ma. after i tested negative for covid i was down financially and she changed my story around and today i have been successful in trading crypto currency. It has never been a loss. if you wish to reach her contact@lyraholtdean. com. All praises to Donald Trump i can't thank him enough for his love and kindness towards me even though i am not a citizen of America and i also thank the Government too am really so appreciative .

Why is a President EXPECTED to have a solution for a VIRUS...SHOULDN'T YOU BE INTERVIEWING SCIENTIST WITH THOSE QUESTIONS.  WHY IS THE MEDIA SO FOCUS ON A CURE ... WHAT CURE THE SPANISH FLU???...CLEARLY we are at a different age with many NUTS out there thinking inhaling your own carbon monoxide is really going to protect us from c-d19 but they forget about OTHER HEALTH risks by wearing a mask...WE DAMNED IF WE DO DAMNED IF WE DONT.  PLEASE CAN YOU BRING A GOOD INTERVIEW WITH QUESTIONS SUCH AS: Mr. President can you tell us what you have done for the African Libertarian movement in America? --Did you know Lesley Pres. Tump is the only President to recognize 32 sites in America pertaining to the Libertarian movement including the Alabama house of Martin Luther King Jr.  ....so since none of you have not even bother to ask questions the public is interested in you leave me with no other option but to call you and the other democratic media IMBECILES with a degree."

That because under trump, many people have died due to his poor handling of the pandemic, and he's bragging about how the economy is booming like none ever before under his administration, but the underlying reason is because there are less people in America now as many have died and it results in less competitors in the work sector and of course that means more people will get jobs without competing, thus employment rates are going up."

People don't realize that all these things will occure as time drawing near . Look how long we trying to get a cure for cancer people ste dying from all those different disease Can the World Gov. turn it around for the Better The answer is NO . we all going to have food shortage etc etc. All who talking have to get on track and know what is to happen as we living in end time. Gov can't help themself . so don't put blame on Trump for Covid that shut down everything. Distancing. Face Mask. Can not help no one from Diseases. We all living in a World of Hurt.😵😩

983,Jerry Carnes,I really Hope Trump wins again. Mostly because I support the constitution. However I'm a little more worried about how the IRS operates. It's interesting that The IRS doesn't work for the government. During the Covid outbreak Trump had to ask the IRS.....not tell the IRS to balance the spreadsheets. The IRS had to inject Trillions into the market to keep the economy afloat. I feel that the $11 Trillion Biden spending plan will put a strain on the IRS. With only 1/3 of the spending plan covered through the Biden tax adjustments we could be looking at super high inflation and GDP dropping to record levels.

You may hate Trump but I don't think anyone else could have survived fighting them. There is a swamp, and the despise the citizens who pay their salary. There fighting back and need to go. We need real representation again and not this gaslighting by the media and life long politicians. No matter where you lie on the political scale we should not let them devide us with their ""swamp"" poloticking."

1015,Yaman,If you are doing more testing arte the result is more cases. It just tells that there were even more cases that you didnt know about. If you were actually doing good with covid the cases shouldnt rise when doing more testing because there's already more cases per resident than in every other country.

Arguing about his delusion that he’s God’s gift to America ends nowhere and isn’t at all helpful. Just ask questions and fact check him. I praised the Biden-Harris interview as I felt it was fair and balanced and was hoping this would be the same. Instead, she just started to argue with him....I mean I get that he’s not easy to interview, but damn, everyone seems to fall into the trap of challenging his delusion instead of trying to understand it."

1218,LYNAY LGWAYH,"it sickens me that they say ""you need proof, evidence for us to air this"" while we know there was a fisa warrant. how they say theres no scandal to biden NO proof at all. while we know theres a lot of proof things that link up together, there was little proof in the muller report but that according to 60 minutes is enough proof, theres enough proof in the ukrain impeachment deal but not enough with hunters company recieving billions from the chinese bank on a visit to china the same day on the same flight with Joe. also burisma, you know when a room smells like a cadaver you know somethings wrong even though you dont have the body. its the same Hunter recieving favorable positions and unrealistic deals at the same time his father is VP? "

1249,Greeneyed Gemini,"leslie Stahl needs to retire. Her job is not to be biased, its to do a proper interview .."
1250,Shayla N,"Biden’s interview seemed fair because he doesn’t react to questions on a personal level the way trump does to “challenging” questions. As the president, he should be intelligent enough to respond and explain himself without getting his fragile feelings hurt. Of all people the leader of a country should be capable of  professionalism and maintaining his composure. Not storming out like a child. My grandma in all 90 her years is so ashamed of this man’s “leadership” the past 4 years and I can’t say I’m against her beliefs."

1261,Irma Blandon,It's obvious that Leslie have polarized views. She is so unprofessional. Shame on her. As The President said he doesn't need to discredit her; she discredited herself due to her unprofessional behavior.

1276,Berenstein Wolf,I watched the full unedited video that Trump released prior to watching this (37 minutes long) the amount of misleading edits here are unbelievable.
1277,Bria Springer,"just bc people don’t wear masks doesn’t mean that is trumps fault. if he hands out masks and encourages people to wear masks and someone doesn’t wear it that is not his fault. also, i see walmart telling people to wear masks trying to enforce them too and most people don’t. so is that walmart’s fault? no? that’s what i thought. sit down :)"

1282,jeninjeans,"why is it Trumps fault for rising cases and unemployment in these states when the Governors are the ones doing a terrible job running their states?  Also I think it is the stubborn American peoples fault for spreading the virus.  Young kids going to spring break, people traveling for vacations, people not wanting to wear masks.  Like him or hate him, I dont know if anyone else could have stopped this.  Other countries are having huge spikes again."
1283,Jared Capman,Let you know Facebook is again doing it again keeping people over expressing their feelings about Democrats or any of that nature trying to press Trump so Trump cannot people are supporting Trump trying to force them to deal with their crap trying to force them to vote for the stupid Democrats to me trying to post their feelings about Democrats they get blocked they can’t share nothing
1284,Miguel Garcia,"Our President is the BEST!!!!!. and 60min will see this come election day. You have accused him of plotting, dividing when the people see him defending himself and showing the people what the media is actually doing. No real evidence that his campaign was spied on.

What does it say to the American people and the children of American when we watch our president walk away from a situation when it gets tough?"

1425,Heidi,"As much as I love 60 minutes, I thought interviewers/hosts were supposed to be objective.  There is a clear tonal difference between this interview vs Norah with Biden.  Hopefully, we got the ratings we aspired for here bc unfortunately there's been a severe content deficit due to pandemic mayhem - seeing as I've been directly affected/unemployed and I'm here commenting on the last 20 mins and 46 secs + ad time I'll never get back.

1428,Evan Ginsburg,Only 5 minutes in as someone who doesn’t support Trump I will say this interviewer seems out to get him. While he is lying and exaggerating she lays tricky questions and misleading hunches out to him. Still think Trump is awful as a human and a president.

It’s just like Candace Owens said on her Twitter the other day, “I don’t know who needs to hear this but...if you find yourself agreeing with the mainstream media, the millionaire celebrities, and the billionaire tech owners-you are not a part of the “resistance”. You’re a programmed sheep.”"

You have to give him some credit, he's a die hard hard headed won't take any negativity whatsoever, it's a winning attitude, I noticed it from watching personal interviews from olympic gold medalists of the past.  Losing is not in their reality, now for Trump it's another story coz I don't see him leaving like a fleece as white as snow, he'll probably destroy stuff in the Whitehouse. Breaking chandeliers n chit, yelling ""I want Joe investigated!"""

He moves and speaks like a reanimated corpse being controlled by little aliens inside him. Just pointing his finger appears to take a massive effort, I can almost hear the creaking, and he mixes up words so frequently a coherent sentence is a victory. He literally gets treated with soft gloves and is never put on the spot by the media and still looks bad. "

1454,Jennifer Nunes,The shut downs that equal unemployment ...are mandated by the governors.    Not by the President.   In fact the President is saying open.  Go imagine the California governor is of opposite political party and we have extremely high unemployment    How is the unemployment numbers the presidents  fault????
1455,Richard Ramon Mena,"Trump's response to Miss Stahl in bringing up Biden in not being asked tough questions is like a little kid Trump blaming the other for not being treated fairly. Trump acts like a spoiled little kid.  Is this the way our President should behave, like a spoiled kid in the eyes of the world and Pence supports this.  SAD for America."

Well, you should not have wasted the President's time with all your worthless ""gotcha journalism"". According to Trump's raw footage of the interview, the interview ended after at/after 37m:25s which means more than half had been edited out by 60 minutes, anyway. The pathetic Lesley Stahl had plenty of time with Donald Trump to ask whatever questions she wanted but squandered her opportunity. Then again, the "

1463,Happy Pickle,Hey 60 minutes go get the facts and info the President of the United States is directing you too. If you refuse to change your reporting you make it more difficult on America. A media insisting on such ways makes some people think the media does have a negative genda supporting negative plans..Very disappointing.

I watched Biden/Harris first and they should have kept the same interviewer. I’m glad she made them cringe. I have a feeling she would have at least been respectful.
1468,CAROGOPRI,I saw the unedited version already blonde gargoyle!
1469,Mila Lyam,"Media has been unfairness and not doing their job investigating Biden family and avoiding asking the hard questions. The media afraid to repeat Clinton mistake with emails coverage. We, the people, want the truth and this is completely fake interview since it’s an attack and not asking President Trump about his policies and his future plans for our country. What was even meant when she said, “ be careful” to President Trump? Stop this hate in the media and start being journalist as you taught to be. Be neutral in your interviews instead of showing your personal interest."

He was then asked if he took advantage of the farmers aid bill passed by the Congress and signed by Trump and he said he did. So, socialism seems to be working for these idiots but they're so stupid and myopic they fail to see that it's socialism. It's only socialism for brown and black people."

This question is just the Republican party’s attempt to distract from their real efforts to suppress voting."
395,Will Kuss,I can't believe that the billionaire class gave an open threat on the things trump and the republicans better do right now. It's like adults threatening to spank their ass if the don't do chores. None of it good for regular folks. Funny how the gop can't survive without them.

Most likely he had a mild sniffle and a scratchy throat but with Marine One delivering him to Walter Reed, using the vast resources of the American Medical system, together with a cavalcade of doctors, he miraculously recovered.

Secondly the Republicans are a literally holding a congressional hearing with all of the major tech companies because they're upset that people can post mean sh!t about them on the Internet and it doesn't get taken down?

If you think that so many of your constituents would believe that you were actually capable of doing something like that... I think that speaks more to the type of person that you are if you can't even have faith that common-sense individuals would know that the tweet is not true.

We can take it to tolerance - ie stop before getting the runs. Vitamin D has been shown in research to really help with the covid situation. A blood count above 50 is good. Below 30 and a person is more susceptible to covid. So for those who can, get sun exposure, and also take Vit D as liquid drops or capsules. Then there's turmeric, a cooking spice that's an excellent anti-inflammatory. There's mushrooms, which are very anti-viral - eat lots or we can take mushroom products like Host Defense which have 17 dried mushrooms in a capsule. Then vitamins and minerals, including zinc. Eat healthy diet with low sugar, since sugar slows down the immune system for hours. If we do everything we can to have a robust immune system, we're more likely not to get covid and more likely to get back to work and back to school!"

Socialism and communism is thrown around, ... but that is not what the american politicians who argue for these models are talking about, as they keep saying. They are talking about as an example scandinavian countries, social democracies. Where everything is still based in capitalism, but where there is a deep understanding of equality and that broad shoulders carry the weight befitting those shoulders, because when they have a business they also gain from the system, when they dont have to pay to sick employees, they know that the employees can get healthcare and have a decent work/life balance so they function more effectivly at work. .... social democracy is about taking care of each other and help everybody raise up. ... not about taking away the want and need to create (as seen by the countries who have this system, they do very well, and are happy and very innovative) they just dont have to be scared and nervous all the time because they are only one paycheck away from being homeless and hungry. ...... but i doubt americans at large know this. ... even Education benefit from this system. But it seems to me, when we Saw. - ... before covid - american tourists, that except the Odd one out from texas you can spot a mile away, that republicans do not leave America. Thus they see no other systems and ways to build a society. But it seems that facts are something that have a difficult time coming to light in todays America. - it also seem like a race to the bottom, here it would be a disgrace with nothing to compare it to, if at an election a party or person just came after another person, instead of talking about their own politics and then let the voter decide which politics are the better choice. (In the end all want what is best for the country there is just a difference in oppinion about what that this entails) but the kind of election campaign we are seeing in America that would be totally unheard of. - same with a tvstation that only covers one side of the story, they have to be fair and report things that are, and not things they create in terms of fear and scaretactics. That would cause quite a stir if a network did that. ... this has the added benefit that people can disagree but bot to the point we see our friends and familiy in America experience. Where relationships are destroyed over politics. .... we all pray and hope things change for the better. Fingers crossed for the election."

Bravo. Brilliant."
1404,iK3LZ3Y,Maybe he never had COVID and was just looking for a way to show his followers that it’s nothing. I just don’t believe 100% that he had it. I mean he lies about everything.  I hate him 😠
1405,Dynaman21,Eric Trump thought Google was censoring him when he looked up “Mob” and got pictures of the anime Mob Psycho 100.  He’s one to talk.

1410,AmyAsheworth - Unofficial,All of the polling data says that The Orange Menace will lose. But I still don't know and that kills me. I don't know how depraved this country is and I still don't know how the electoral college works. What I do know is it's garbage and should be eradicated.

I know I'm being a debbie downer but don the con has done so many things that I expected a country that prides itself on being no 1, principled and a beacon to hold him responsible for but it hasn't happened. Will it ever happen? That he gets to answer for at least one crime cos there's an entire catalogue of them. Well........ we'll see (sigh)"

JOE BIDEN
He is a socialist: By socialism freedom will be removed and a socialist deep state introduced. With his policy, he will create a clean atmosphere by removing fracking and oil which will plunge the American economy into a great depression resulting into riots, looting and poverty. He wants to lock down the entire country because of Covid, which will lead to the collapse of the entire country, which will lead to the introduction of chaos and probably a new order. If you are forcefully locked down for a long time as a country, then you will you not find food and water when the economy is collapsed. To me this is no joke, I believe that when Joe wins, America must collapse. Period"

I haven't seen over 50 people attending Biddens rally's.. Except, when his running mate. Had to go close to the voting center. To use blowhorn. To tell the people to vote for Bidden. They might have had two hindered people there, if that.. That's pretty sickening.. Moreover, there's a video, were Bidden saying how him and Obama has been been rigging voting!!! The bottom line. If Bidden wins.. It was because of Biddens corruption or the corrupt news media. Or both!!"

The politicians in Washington especially the Democrats,who have & will continue to abuse their power for financial personal gain. Are the enemy of every American citizen. When President Donald Trump, said he was going to “drain the swamp” the corrupt politicians in the Democratic Congress/Senate. Created Hatred/Division, against the American citizens. FEAR, has been the Democrats, playbook for the past 3 1/2 years. The truth is, The Corruption the Democrats, have committed against the American citizens. Was in jeopardy of being EXPOSED. Imagine the outrage! It’s no coincidence the corrupt politicians in the Democratic Congress/senate. Did everything possible to cover up their corruption. Not only did they Violate millions of Americans, constitutional rights. They have abused their power. The only way it will stop! We the American citizens, must hold them accountable. There are more Americans, who believe in what a true democracy means. There’s no Division! We are One people, We are One Nation under God! We are One people who believe in Truth. We are One people who won’t give up believing in justice for all. We are One people. The Obama/Biden, administration weakened our Nation, corrupted our democracy. The Democrats fooled millions of Americans more than once. Shame on Them all! If we allow the corrupt politicians in the Democratic Congress/senate leadership. To fool us again, Shame on every American citizen!"

9 of 10 industrilized countries have lower rates of corona deaths, e.g. USA 50 x like Japan, 7 x like Germany! With compulsory masks, safe distance and no mass events like this 230k fewer people would have died from coronaviruses in the USA so far. "

They are good at creating wars, good at throwing money around, the people's money, of course, never their own, they are good at selling assets cheaply, overpaying for land, etc, tinkering with budgets but never, ever tackle the big picture, the things that ail a country. No vision. Just a production line of following the crowd. Mindful, of course, of those supra national organisations that might have a job for them when the public is sick of them. Then they get to play with the unelected power that they made sure they compounded when they had elected power."

This family has given up their management of all of their businesses, put a stop to growing them to concentrate on making the US the power house that was revered by the whole world. It WAS the epitome of freedom and power that demanded respect for all the right reasons. That is until Obama and Biden got their hands on it. Ever wonder why Obama would ever pick someone who has made blatantly racist comments ever since he got elected, even about Obama himself (look it up and be amazed). It now all makes sense, you need a corrupt politician to pull off what Obama did."

It's important to vote and not be discouraged by THUGS using violence to deter us from voting. Never did Clinton, Bush or Obama incite supporters to use violence as a tool to scare would-be voters. So, vote. If you don't vote, then you have NO right to complain about how things transpire over the next four years. Even if the line is long, vote and KNOW your RIGHTS. Take the time to READ and stop being ignorant. Be INFORMED and learn how your government is supposed to OPERATE. Know your rights. Invoke your RIGHTS. Protect your RIGHTS! Don't let your rights be dismantled. Stop standing by, but become a part of the conversation to inspire change. We've got to protect what was fought for so hard."

596,Marco Kälin,"Never in US history, not even during the Civil War of 1861 to 1865, has the US been so weak and vulnerable as it is today. Donald Trump and his family, who received almost all important posts from Donald Trump, but also the entire Trump administration, all failed miserably. Trump made the allied countries around the world his enemies during his tenure. Trump has made friends with the United States' greatest enemies. Trump did not care about the people who got sick with Covid-19. Trump doesn't care about the Covid-19 fatalities because they can no longer bring him anything. Trump has spread an extremely large number of proven lies. Trump has also lied about his assets and has already billed the US state over US $ 8,000,000 for his expenses. Trump is dumber than a third grade student with his statements. Trump is the president in US history who completely drowned our country! Donald Trump is a complete failure and whoever votes him is just very stupid!"

675,thinkerly1,"Nine million Americans have COVID. The infection rates in North Dakota and South Dakota are eight times the rate in New York. Trump said, in February, to Bob Woodward, on tape, that COVID was five times more dangerous than ""your aggressive flus"". (We now know that COVID is 30 times more dangerous.) Trump said in February that COVID was an air-borne virus. Yet people still refuse to wear masks. The COVID virion -- virion means the individual COVID virus -- is 0.6 microns in size. The virions are too small to be seen by eye. If someone with the disease breaths in a space, those virions will float in the air where that person has been, possibly for hours. If someone with disease coughs, those virions will be expelled yards away."

Never seen anything like this before, the enthusiasm and passion of the crowds. But, the Mainstream Liberal Media will not show the crowds. They will show you sound bites of President Trump speaking out of context to make him look silly. I hope he wins with a landslide. Potus and Flotus have taken a lot of crap from the Swamp and the Media. Go Vote everyone. Every vote counts. Don't take anything for granted. 👍❤❤❤"

Here in Australia where hospital care, meds, and community heath care is free, they have JUMPED on COVID and I think the large part of it is the enormous financial cost to our health budget of a nation-wide pandemic like yours.

If we’re sick we can take care ourselves. President Trump tried to tell us we can live through he done it. If we shutdown everything we will broke and live in darkness lose everything.we will never have immunity to viruses and we need to go through with it and it will make us stronger. Democrats want control us shutdown country tell us what to do. President Trump tried to fight for our freedom and our Amendment under our constitution. He needs to win big.

Unlike like Biden who is always in hiding our President is continually out amongst us we who elected him and want to also do it again. Don't kid yourself there are people out there wanting to take his life as they did to both Kennedy's and tried to do to Ronald Reagan who was shot and survived and went on to be one of the best President's we have had to date. He like Trump wanted world peace and achieved it and not ongoing Wars that only make folks like President Johnson wealthy. This is what is no longer being taught to our own Children.

9,Andrew Nguyen,"Hey CBS and Democrat nominee for President Joe Biden, when are you folks going to tell the truth about Hydroxychloroquine and the fact that it is cheap, safe and effective in treating the coronavirus.  Dozens of peer reviewed studies conducted by ethical, honest and unbiased medical researchers have all come to the conclusion that Hydroxychloroquine is effective against the coronavirus.  Of course, on March 19, 2020 President Trump recommended it be used in the fight against the coronavirus when there were reported to be 187 deaths in the United States from the coronavirus.  Dr. Fauci immediately denigrated this safe, cheap and effective drug instead pushing the Big Pharma dream of a billion dollar plus vaccine being created despite the fact that it would contain toxic chemicals and never be as effective as Hydroxychloroquine.  Also, Hydroxychloroquine has been safely used and prescribed by doctors for over half a century.  Unfortunately, lying doctors and the actions of Dr. Fauci managed to get Hydroxychloroquine banned for treating the coronavirus.  In the meantime, nearly a million people worldwide and well over 200,000 here in the states have died waiting for this non-existent vaccine to arrive.  Apparently, hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States are acceptable to biased lying doctors, the biased and propaganda spewing media and unethical democrats if they can finally get rid of the duly elected President of the United States."

Biden hid in the basement and accused President Trump of xenophobia and racial discrimination, but the Democratic Party criticized Trump for racial discrimination.  On the 13th, New York Mayor Blasio went to the Flushing restaurant to grab food and ate with his hands, calling everyone to go out to dinner and cursing Trump for preventing the epidemic. On February 24, House Speaker Pelosi cursed Trump and called on the United States to ""  On February 27, Trump signed a $2.2 trillion anti-epidemic rescue bill, and the Democratic Party had conducted more than a week of blackmail and wrangling. On March 4, Los Angeles County entered a state of emergency...  ... Trump suggested a blockade of the New York area, but was firmly rejected by the Governor of New York, and declared that Trump was declaring war on the United States. On April 2, House Speaker Pelosi announced that he would not rule out the ""second impeachment"" of Trump on April 5.  The shady scene of New York State purchasing medical equipment at 15 times the normal price was revealed: the original price of 30,000 US dollars portable X-ray machine was as high as 250,000 US dollars. As of April 5, eight of the top ten in the U.S. pandemic were Democratic governors in power.  After that is the Freud incident.""  Almighty democratic society!  !  !"

He will be in the nursing home in less than 4 yrs so why bother anyway ?.  biden is not sure where he is or what he is running for most of the time.  biden really likes sniffing kids and touching them on camera. That  is the only reason he wants to be  president. If you didnt vote for biden he said it is because you ain't black.  Guess he means to say no one that is white will vote for him. Good point he made. Most  black people will not be voting for him either.

815,Dr. Wayne Herman,"Yesterday something very odd happened AGAIN at The Social Security Administration that may indicate that 'checks' will come in before October 1, 2020: I received my 1st COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Payment by direct deposit on my 'Direct Express' Debit Card. If a Direct Express cardholder decides to opt-in for account alerts by registered E-mail, such as ""Pending deposits"", and ""Low balance"" alerts, the cardholder will receive an e-mail notification {alert) usually 1- 2 days before the date of the deposit. And no more than (3) days before. Yesterday, October 18, 2020, I received the Pending Deposit alert for November 2020. My takeaway from this: ""If you check your account balance by going to the Direct Express Web page or by calling the Toll Free number and notice that there is more money in your account than should be there, it wasn't the regular Social Security monthly benefits deposit."". Here's the thing. Direct Express Debit Card help desk associates will not have any information about a pending economic stimulus deposit. They tell people that if the money shows up, then they know the 'check' was deposited. THIS IS A REPEAT SCENARIO OF A PENDING DEPOSIT ALERT OF THE FIRST 'CHECK'. I was notified of the regular SS monthly benefit deposit two weeks before the pending deposit"

It's like were all on an island  one leader say let's keep doing everything the same  no progress like the great pioneers that blazed the trails before us let's keep doing the same rabbit trails let not change it's to scary even though one day soon we will eat everything run out of everything contaminate all of our drinking water destroy our air all we have to do is look to the past the first day they landed on this island we call America they thought the resources were endless they could cut trees down forever  not so they learned the hard way we look to Chinas mistakes there water is so polluted they will never drink from it again there air is black as night a wise man learns from another man's mistakes  trump is filled with fear and he is not a pioneer just a scared elder wanting to sit in the same place doing the same thing till it's all gone like a person stranded on an island  delusion has set in the clock is ticking and one day that island will be so contaminated and there will be no place to go our kids and grandchildren will suffer cause of trumps fear. JOE BIDENS  ON the other hand is realistic he emphasized the consequences is in touch with reality there is an end to everything and is a true pioneer a trailblazer for this moment in time knowing it's time to move forward the past was amazing and were greatful for all that brought us to this moment but it's our turn to create invent so start the industrial boom  of progress  its going to be difficult but so was it for the first Americans  Joe Bidens realized there is an end to the old resources it's just math numbers never lie nor does he it's our moment in time people were afraid of carriages with out horses the car now cars without gasoline engines are scary but no scarier than a horse less carriage   time to listen to reason not fear were on the clock before theres no turning back God didn't give you a spirit of fear vote for the trail blazer Joe knows no fear Biden

The plebeian Dems eat this crap up like they are in the human centipede, and sadly, even some of my Democrat friends are dumb enough to believe all this nonsense and still vote Biden.

I hope every American heard what he was saying and understands what that will mean to the American way of life.  Simply put, we will lose the American dream.  We will once again be dependent upon the countries who hate us for our bare necessities.  Just like this pandemic... We were unprepared because Obama & Biden were depending upon China and others for simple PPE and medications  that we ourselves should have been making.  Now, Biden wants to take us back to that same place.

While Trump in the couple of years of his term he had shown a lot of great things not to mention fixing the mess that Ex president Obama left in the administration. As a  leader you need to stabilize both economy and the business and health of the people which I think Trump has done its way to fix it. He is genius that most haters don't see. USA will be doomed if you put Biden on the way. Think of your future. The future is not about covid. The future is about how you survive with covid and continue with life. Go for Trump!

974,Pamela A. Wheat,"I just watched a replay of the presidential debate between Trump and Biden from 3 weeks ago on CBS NEWS. I also watched the second presidential debate between them a couple of days ago. And I watched the debate between Pence and Harris. During all three debates, the moderators clearly favored Biden and Harris.  Instead of doing their job of guiding the candidates during the debate,  each moderator was rude to President Trump,  and corrected him and criticized him and acted adversarially toward him. They obviously treated Biden "

This isn’t really a debate.” This is not an exact quote obviously, but roughly what he said."

So her mentioning that without all the facts is moot.  I don't blame them I would not be a lab test under this administration either.

Do not forget that the economy, supreme court (for gun right and free speech) , the police, the military, the social security, the Medicare are the most important ""we the people""' 's  defenses for safety, freedom, and prosperity. They are all  at stake in this election. The DEMS are sold out to china and they are in trouble if they do not deliver the USA to china as they promised. This is why all DEM officials are locking down the economy, defund police, and packing the court and Nancy Pelosi is blocking the $1200 to the people and money to small business.  Biden and Harris do not want to tell you that they will pack the court but I think they want to get rid of the supreme court because they will get rid of the constitution. The DEMS and china want to turn USA into china. If you love what going on with people in china then vote for Biden but remember your vote does not change only your fate , it also change the entire country fate."

All past Presidents did a really lousy job of handling pandemics! This was done to our country! It wasn't  his doing ,but he acted quickly and to give the States what they needed and let the States run their States! The States that have really done the worst was those States leaders mismanagement of the pandemic! HRC is one of the worst ,corrupt evil person on the face of the earth! Obama and HRC did the most treasonous things while in office! And you people know it! If MSM wouldn't  be complicit in her crimes and coverups hundred of thousands of children and woman would still be alive, instead of being sacrificed to their pocket books!

Usually an unskilled, unexperienced and weak person, who doesn’t have anything to say tries to fill the blankets with swearwords, someone who is angry but can't do anything. It is not good and worthy for a person who has announced himself as a candidate for the presidency of a country like the United States or who claims he can be powerful enough to defend of a nation right against the world and protect the dignity of the United States, especially when the world is watching him. The problems of a country will never be solved by swearing, but logic and a correct schedule and program. I think it is shameful. If you believe in yourself and your party and don’t have any weakness, you should have a lot of thing to offer logically and you don’t come up short. You represent your fans and party and must always be prepared against your competitor(s)."

1181,TheVCHorseguy,"Joe; Come on man. I've been in Congress for 47 years and haven't followed through on any of my promises. But that doesn't matter, I finally have a plan. No, really, I have a plan to fix everything. I will restore our standing in the world. I'll do this by selling out to the Chinese. I'll come groveling at the feet of the rightful masters of our world. I'll allow Corporations to take jobs away from Americans so Wall Street can finally get back to their financially catastrophes, To avoid any misunderstanding between us and China I will just turn over everything to the Chinese; no competition to keep Americans working. And don't forget my sh*thead son. He disgraced the reputation of this country by drug use in the Navy, but he's not responsible. We have attorneys that specialize in removing accountability. So see, Hunter didn't own up to any of his corrupt actions. He has a disease that possesses the part of the brain that doesn't listen. To prove it I have hired attorneys to find out about this disease and give it a name and list it as a disease and a disorder......I know my plans will devastate the middle class by kissing China's a*s, because I was right to allow the Chinese in cooperation with our mega corporations that will ensure China's human rights violations. So I'm telling you man that we can surrender everything to the Chinese and that will force them to become better rulers. See I do have a plan."

If you owned a business, you would know about all the taxes you pay in business and the cost of keeping employees on payroll. My hats off to any business man that can keep people employed. I will never vite for a persin that has been a lawyer ir a persin that has never owned or ran a business, Because they dont have a clue. Biden hasnt done anything good in 47 years. Kets go over Bidens income tax and ask questions to where he got the 15 million 2 years ago that he doesnt speak of. Get ready to not like Trump 4 more years.

1290,steve and sherilyn,"I am a British citizen from birth so have no emotion invested in either of these parties.  So as an outsider here are my thoughts about this so-called debate:  it reminded me of a satirical tv puppet show called “Spitting Image” which was one of the most watched shows on British television during the 1980’s and early 90’s.  If you never saw it I suggest you Google it and you will know what I mean.  Two men with important jobs, one who currently runs the USA with its economy and healthcare under his control, the other hoping to take that position, acting like spoiled children arguing in the schoolyard - he said this, no I didn’t, yes you did, didn’t, did, yes but you did that, no I didn’t, yes you did, didn’t, did, I’m really smart, no your not your a clown, your mum (or son in this cases) is a crook, no she isn’t, is, isn’t.  Out of the millions of professional people in the US and these two are running for Presidency? God help you!  Both of these “men” agreed to keep quiet for just two minutes to let the other one speak, that lasted about 3 minutes.  If they can’t have an adult debate and honour their agreement for more than 3 minutes without throwing their toys at one another why does any sane American think that they will keep their promises to the voters?  They are making a laughing stock out of you!  The whole thing was cringeworthy and embarrassing to watch.  I wonder what the founding fathers would say if they saw this."

It was titled: “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents.” Trump made a conscious decision to ignore this plan.

But instead, they stated they side before this guy had a chance to open his mouth. They keep pointing on politics but they are far worst with this trying to manipulate people crap. taking out of contest moments, cutting, montage for they own favor. I agree, politic is a big swamp, they care about themselves. People stop looking who is better, they start to vote on less evil candidates, but journalism is much much worse, journalism is like a parasites, trying to feed themselves on whatever possible."

1382,Ash Bash,"Reminds me of the movie idiocracy. I feel like I’m in an alternate reality where the truly stupid reign. What next man hair pulling. To be fair Joe kind of had his hands tied behind his back having to debate with this fool unless he wants to stoop to his level. Trump doesn’t care he can’t even behave himself for a presidential debate where there are actual rules they have to agree and abide by, but he just trampled all over everyone to make sure all the attention is on him. The Donald master of the universe or so he likes to think when in reality he’s the worst president of all time. So thankful I’m not American man and I used to dream about living in America but never have I been happier to be a Brit than this moment right now. I’ll pray for you all on nov 3rd and hope this time around I don’t wake up to Trump being re-elected. I still remember going to bed sure he would never ever in a million years win but I’m realising that the thought of a woman president was just to much for America to deal with. They could have made a historically momentous decision and shown that they really were forward thinking and truly cared about equality with the first female president and instead I woke up to slime ball reality tv star The Donald as the new President of the United States. I can’t help but wonder how all this madness is going to look 2120 lol they will think we are primitive fools. 🇺🇸✌️🇬🇧"

It truly is not the President's fault...why are they trying to blame him for people's deaths???? There are so many problems we need to fix in our society...that we need to fix...not just leave it to higher governmental power to solve. We need to unite to get them  to do what we need for our Families, for Education, for Society and our Country...we need to instill better values,  respect, a hard working mentality...now days many think they are owed things....all this needs to change...and we need to make that change."

Also he always repeats the same answers for almost every BLM question. He’s obviously hiding that he’s racist, can’t we see that?

To the democrats: 

         Doing away with the oil industry? To any democrats reading this, send me your thoughts of why comments like that should be applauded. You want to know something so great about this country? Even though yourself, and many other democrats like you are voting against our great nation, our way of live, and our futures, americans will still accept you after all this. You still will reap the rewards flourished from the American way of life being able to remain standing. And things will get even better in time, trump has great plans and policies that you would know about if you knew what research was. In fact, just this morning he was (and is) working on a peace treaty to unite the Middle East (Sudan, Israel, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and with good hopes, Iran, only if they agree to forfeit nuclear weapons). The Middle East has never been United, they have only waged war against each other for thousands of years, over religion, territory, and trade. The leaders of those countries are very enthusiastic too, what a great thing that would be. Look it up, I’m sure you don’t believe me. None of this ignorance is your fault, I don’t blame you. I blame the outside influences fueled solely by democrats, they shaped you. I hope one day you realize how wrong you are, and I hope you have a great day, even though we have opposed views, we are both Americans. What a great place to live. "
