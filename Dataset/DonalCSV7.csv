57,Andrew Nguyen,"Hey CBS and Democrat nominee for President Joe Biden, when are you folks going to tell the truth about Hydroxychloroquine and the fact that it is cheap, safe and effective in treating the coronavirus.  Dozens of peer reviewed studies conducted by ethical, honest and unbiased medical researchers have all come to the conclusion that Hydroxychloroquine is effective against the coronavirus.  Of course, on March 19, 2020 President Trump recommended it be used in the fight against the coronavirus when there were reported to be 187 deaths in the United States from the coronavirus.  Dr. Fauci immediately denigrated this safe, cheap and effective drug instead pushing the Big Pharma dream of a billion dollar plus vaccine being created despite the fact that it would contain toxic chemicals and never be as effective as Hydroxychloroquine.  Also, Hydroxychloroquine has been safely used and prescribed by doctors for over half a century.  Unfortunately, lying doctors and the actions of Dr. Fauci managed to get Hydroxychloroquine banned for treating the coronavirus.  In the meantime, nearly a million people worldwide and well over 200,000 here in the states have died waiting for this non-existent vaccine to arrive.  Apparently, hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States are acceptable to biased lying doctors, the biased and propaganda spewing media and unethical democrats if they can finally get rid of the duly elected President of the United States."

78,Duffel Sally,"""On January 31st, Trump announced a ban on epidemic prevention and prevent Chinese people from entering the United States from planes from China. Biden hid in the basement and accused President Trump of xenophobia and racial discrimination, but the Democratic Party criticized Trump for racial discrimination.  On the 13th, New York Mayor Blasio went to the Flushing restaurant to grab food and ate with his hands, calling everyone to go out to dinner and cursing Trump for preventing the epidemic. On February 24, House Speaker Pelosi cursed Trump and called on the United States to ""  On February 27, Trump signed a $2.2 trillion anti-epidemic rescue bill, and the Democratic Party had conducted more than a week of blackmail and wrangling. On March 4, Los Angeles County entered a state of emergency...  ... Trump suggested a blockade of the New York area, but was firmly rejected by the Governor of New York, and declared that Trump was declaring war on the United States. On April 2, House Speaker Pelosi announced that he would not rule out the ""second impeachment"" of Trump on April 5.  The shady scene of New York State purchasing medical equipment at 15 times the normal price was revealed: the original price of 30,000 US dollars portable X-ray machine was as high as 250,000 US dollars. As of April 5, eight of the top ten in the U.S. pandemic were Democratic governors in power.  After that is the Freud incident.""  Almighty democratic society!  !  !"

He will be in the nursing home in less than 4 yrs so why bother anyway ?.  biden is not sure where he is or what he is running for most of the time.  biden really likes sniffing kids and touching them on camera. That  is the only reason he wants to be  president. If you didnt vote for biden he said it is because you ain't black.  Guess he means to say no one that is white will vote for him. Good point he made. Most  black people will not be voting for him either.

752,Dr. Wayne Herman,"Yesterday something very odd happened AGAIN at The Social Security Administration that may indicate that 'checks' will come in before October 1, 2020: I received my 1st COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Payment by direct deposit on my 'Direct Express' Debit Card. If a Direct Express cardholder decides to opt-in for account alerts by registered E-mail, such as ""Pending deposits"", and ""Low balance"" alerts, the cardholder will receive an e-mail notification {alert) usually 1- 2 days before the date of the deposit. And no more than (3) days before. Yesterday, October 18, 2020, I received the Pending Deposit alert for November 2020. My takeaway from this: ""If you check your account balance by going to the Direct Express Web page or by calling the Toll Free number and notice that there is more money in your account than should be there, it wasn't the regular Social Security monthly benefits deposit."". Here's the thing. Direct Express Debit Card help desk associates will not have any information about a pending economic stimulus deposit. They tell people that if the money shows up, then they know the 'check' was deposited. THIS IS A REPEAT SCENARIO OF A PENDING DEPOSIT ALERT OF THE FIRST 'CHECK'. I was notified of the regular SS monthly benefit deposit two weeks before the pending deposit"

JOE BIDENS  ON the other hand is realistic he emphasized the consequences is in touch with reality there is an end to everything and is a true pioneer a trailblazer for this moment in time knowing it's time to move forward the past was amazing and were greatful for all that brought us to this moment but it's our turn to create invent so start the industrial boom  of progress  its going to be difficult but so was it for the first Americans  Joe Bidens realized there is an end to the old resources it's just math numbers never lie nor does he it's our moment in time people were afraid of carriages with out horses the car now cars without gasoline engines are scary but no scarier than a horse less carriage   time to listen to reason not fear were on the clock before theres no turning back God didn't give you a spirit of fear vote for the trail blazer Joe knows no fear Biden

The plebeian Dems eat this crap up like they are in the human centipede, and sadly, even some of my Democrat friends are dumb enough to believe all this nonsense and still vote Biden.

While Trump in the couple of years of his term he had shown a lot of great things not to mention fixing the mess that Ex president Obama left in the administration. As a  leader you need to stabilize both economy and the business and health of the people which I think Trump has done its way to fix it. He is genius that most haters don't see. USA will be doomed if you put Biden on the way. Think of your future. The future is not about covid. The future is about how you survive with covid and continue with life. Go for Trump! Trump always use numbers with a relevant explanation."

I also watched the second presidential debate between them a couple of days ago. And I watched the debate between Pence and Harris. During all three debates, the moderators clearly favored Biden and Harris.  Instead of doing their job of guiding the candidates during the debate,  each moderator was rude to President Trump,  and corrected him and criticized him and acted adversarially toward him. They obviously treated Biden "

Do not forget that the economy, supreme court (for gun right and free speech) , the police, the military, the social security, the Medicare are the most important ""we the people""' 's  defenses for safety, freedom, and prosperity. They are all  at stake in this election. The DEMS are sold out to china and they are in trouble if they do not deliver the USA to china as they promised. This is why all DEM officials are locking down the economy, defund police, and packing the court and Nancy Pelosi is blocking the $1200 to the people and money to small business.  Biden and Harris do not want to tell you that they will pack the court but I think they want to get rid of the supreme court because they will get rid of the constitution. The DEMS and china want to turn USA into china. If you love what going on with people in china then vote for Biden but remember your vote does not change only your fate , it also change the entire country fate."

Usually an unskilled, unexperienced and weak person, who doesn‚Äôt have anything to say tries to fill the blankets with swearwords, someone who is angry but can't do anything. It is not good and worthy for a person who has announced himself as a candidate for the presidency of a country like the United States or who claims he can be powerful enough to defend of a nation right against the world and protect the dignity of the United States, especially when the world is watching him. The problems of a country will never be solved by swearing, but logic and a correct schedule and program. I think it is shameful. If you believe in yourself and your party and don‚Äôt have any weakness, you should have a lot of thing to offer logically and you don‚Äôt come up short. You represent your fans and party and must always be prepared against your competitor(s)."

With his dynamism, wisdom coupled proportionally by convention and concurrence, his bold, daring and firm decisions, he can repress rogue regimes like the chinese, to establish world order, peace, security, prosperity to all global nations.  There are going to be innumerable elections in future and democrsts can try their hand during those.  If mr. Biden is voted to power, China will take upperhand and try to fulfil its misplaced and totally undeserving superpower aspirations. And soft ss the democrats generally are with mr.

I'll come groveling at the feet of the rightful masters of our world. I'll allow Corporations to take jobs away from Americans so Wall Street can finally get back to their financially catastrophes, To avoid any misunderstanding between us and China I will just turn over everything to the Chinese; no competition to keep Americans working. And don't forget my sh*thead son. He disgraced the reputation of this country by drug use in the Navy, but he's not responsible. We have attorneys that specialize in removing accountability. So see, Hunter didn't own up to any of his corrupt actions. He has a disease that possesses the part of the brain that doesn't listen. To prove it I have hired attorneys to find out about this disease and give it a name and list it as a disease and a disorder......I know my plans will devastate the middle class by kissing China's a*s, because I was right to allow the Chinese in cooperation with our mega corporations that will ensure China's human rights violations. So I'm telling you man that we can surrender everything to the Chinese and that will force them to become better rulers. See I do have a plan."

I will never vite for a persin that has been a lawyer ir a persin that has never owned or ran a business, Because they dont have a clue. Biden hasnt done anything good in 47 years.

So as an outsider here are my thoughts about this so-called debate:  it reminded me of a satirical tv puppet show called ‚ÄúSpitting Image‚Äù which was one of the most watched shows on British television during the 1980‚Äôs and early 90‚Äôs.  If you never saw it I suggest you Google it and you will know what I mean.  Two men with important jobs, one who currently runs the USA with its economy and healthcare under his control, the other hoping to take that position, acting like spoiled children arguing in the schoolyard - he said this, no I didn‚Äôt, yes you did, didn‚Äôt, did, yes but you did that, no I didn‚Äôt, yes you did, didn‚Äôt, did, I‚Äôm really smart, no your not your a clown, your mum (or son in this cases) is a crook, no she isn‚Äôt, is, isn‚Äôt.  Out of the millions of professional people in the US and these two are running for Presidency? God help you!  Both of these ‚Äúmen‚Äù agreed to keep quiet for just two minutes to let the other one speak, that lasted about 3 minutes.  If they can‚Äôt have an adult debate and honour their agreement for more than 3 minutes without throwing their toys at one another why does any sane American think that they will keep their promises to the voters?  They are making a laughing stock out of you!  The whole thing was cringeworthy and embarrassing to watch.  I wonder what the founding fathers would say if they saw this."
