57,Andrew Nguyen,"Hey CBS and Democrat nominee for President Joe Biden, when are you folks going to tell the truth about Hydroxychloroquine and the fact that it is cheap, safe and effective in treating the coronavirus.  Dozens of peer reviewed studies conducted by ethical, honest and unbiased medical researchers have all come to the conclusion that Hydroxychloroquine is effective against the coronavirus.  Of course, on March 19, 2020 President Trump recommended it be used in the fight against the coronavirus when there were reported to be 187 deaths in the United States from the coronavirus.  Dr. Fauci immediately denigrated this safe, cheap and effective drug instead pushing the Big Pharma dream of a billion dollar plus vaccine being created despite the fact that it would contain toxic chemicals and never be as effective as Hydroxychloroquine.  Also, Hydroxychloroquine has been safely used and prescribed by doctors for over half a century.  Unfortunately, lying doctors and the actions of Dr. Fauci managed to get Hydroxychloroquine banned for treating the coronavirus.  In the meantime, nearly a million people worldwide and well over 200,000 here in the states have died waiting for this non-existent vaccine to arrive.  Apparently, hundreds of thousands of deaths in the United States are acceptable to biased lying doctors, the biased and propaganda spewing media and unethical democrats if they can finally get rid of the duly elected President of the United States."

78,Duffel Sally,"""On January 31st, Trump announced a ban on epidemic prevention and prevent Chinese people from entering the United States from planes from China. Biden hid in the basement and accused President Trump of xenophobia and racial discrimination, but the Democratic Party criticized Trump for racial discrimination.  On the 13th, New York Mayor Blasio went to the Flushing restaurant to grab food and ate with his hands, calling everyone to go out to dinner and cursing Trump for preventing the epidemic. On February 24, House Speaker Pelosi cursed Trump and called on the United States to ""  On February 27, Trump signed a $2.2 trillion anti-epidemic rescue bill, and the Democratic Party had conducted more than a week of blackmail and wrangling. On March 4, Los Angeles County entered a state of emergency...  ... Trump suggested a blockade of the New York area, but was firmly rejected by the Governor of New York, and declared that Trump was declaring war on the United States. On April 2, House Speaker Pelosi announced that he would not rule out the ""second impeachment"" of Trump on April 5.  The shady scene of New York State purchasing medical equipment at 15 times the normal price was revealed: the original price of 30,000 US dollars portable X-ray machine was as high as 250,000 US dollars. As of April 5, eight of the top ten in the U.S. pandemic were Democratic governors in power.  After that is the Freud incident.""  Almighty democratic society!  !  !"

291,Got Wings Tv,..Noone in their right mind is gonna vote for biden. He didn't vote for himself even cause he is white. He will be in the nursing home in less than 4 yrs so why bother anyway ?.  biden is not sure where he is or what he is running for most of the time.  biden really likes sniffing kids and touching them on camera. That  is the only reason he wants to be  president. If you didnt vote for biden he said it is because you ain't black.  Guess he means to say no one that is white will vote for him. Good point he made. Most  black people will not be voting for him either.

752,Dr. Wayne Herman,"Yesterday something very odd happened AGAIN at The Social Security Administration that may indicate that 'checks' will come in before October 1, 2020: I received my 1st COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Payment by direct deposit on my 'Direct Express' Debit Card. If a Direct Express cardholder decides to opt-in for account alerts by registered E-mail, such as ""Pending deposits"", and ""Low balance"" alerts, the cardholder will receive an e-mail notification {alert) usually 1- 2 days before the date of the deposit. And no more than (3) days before. Yesterday, October 18, 2020, I received the Pending Deposit alert for November 2020. My takeaway from this: ""If you check your account balance by going to the Direct Express Web page or by calling the Toll Free number and notice that there is more money in your account than should be there, it wasn't the regular Social Security monthly benefits deposit."". Here's the thing. Direct Express Debit Card help desk associates will not have any information about a pending economic stimulus deposit.

It's like were all on an island  one leader say let's keep doing everything the same  no progress like the great pioneers that blazed the trails before us let's keep doing the same rabbit trails let not change it's to scary even though one day soon we will eat everything run out of everything contaminate all of our drinking water destroy our air all we have to do is look to the past the first day they landed on this island we call America they thought the resources were endless they could cut trees down forever  not so they learned the hard way we look to Chinas mistakes there water is so polluted they will never drink from it again there air is black as night a wise man learns from another man's mistakes  trump is filled with fear and he is not a pioneer just a scared elder wanting to sit in the same place doing the same thing till it's all gone like a person stranded on an island  delusion has set in the clock is ticking and one day that island will be so contaminated and there will be no place to go our kids and grandchildren will suffer cause of trumps fear. JOE BIDENS  ON the other hand is realistic he emphasized the consequences is in touch with reality there is an end to everything and is a true pioneer a trailblazer for this moment in time knowing it's time to move forward the past was amazing and were greatful for all that brought us to this moment but it's our turn to create invent so start the industrial boom  of progress  its going to be difficult but so was it for the first Americans  Joe Bidens realized there is an end to the old resources it's just math numbers never lie nor does he it's our moment in time people were afraid of carriages with out horses the car now cars without gasoline engines are scary but no scarier than a horse less carriage   time to listen to reason not fear were on the clock before theres no turning back God didn't give you a spirit of fear vote for the trail blazer Joe knows no fear Biden

The plebeian Dems eat this crap up like they are in the human centipede, and sadly, even some of my Democrat friends are dumb enough to believe all this nonsense and still vote Biden.

We were unprepared because Obama & Biden were depending upon China and others for simple PPE and medications  that we ourselves should have been making.  Now, Biden wants to take us back to that same place.

As a  leader you need to stabilize both economy and the business and health of the people which I think Trump has done its way to fix it. He is genius that most haters don't see. USA will be doomed if you put Biden on the way. Think of your future. The future is not about covid. The future is about how you survive with covid and continue with life. Go for Trump!

Instead of doing their job of guiding the candidates during the debate,  each moderator was rude to President Trump,  and corrected him and criticized him and acted adversarially toward him. They obviously treated Biden "
938,Gary The Rocker White,You and george paid people to riot and they bought impliments and had them delivered to riot areas knowiing people would use bricks when you put them there joe and george payed people to use them that w hy the cops steped back and when people were being hurt and you refuse the natinal guard

940,Iris The Eye,"My teacher who teaches elements of debate had said in class today, “I’ll use the presidential debate as an example for the Link and Douglas debate. This is a bad example since it’s not really a debate, just two people against each other using playground insults. This isn’t really a debate.” This is not an exact quote obviously, but roughly what he said."

Do not forget that the economy, supreme court (for gun right and free speech) , the police, the military, the social security, the Medicare are the most important ""we the people""' 's  defenses for safety, freedom, and prosperity. They are all  at stake in this election. The DEMS are sold out to china and they are in trouble if they do not deliver the USA to china as they promised. This is why all DEM officials are locking down the economy, defund police, and packing the court and Nancy Pelosi is blocking the $1200 to the people and money to small business.  Biden and Harris do not want to tell you that they will pack the court but I think they want to get rid of the supreme court because they will get rid of the constitution. The DEMS and china want to turn USA into china. If you love what going on with people in china then vote for Biden but remember your vote does not change only your fate , it also change the entire country fate."

Usually an unskilled, unexperienced and weak person, who doesn’t have anything to say tries to fill the blankets with swearwords, someone who is angry but can't do anything. It is not good and worthy for a person who has announced himself as a candidate for the presidency of a country like the United States or who claims he can be powerful enough to defend of a nation right against the world and protect the dignity of the United States, especially when the world is watching him. The problems of a country will never be solved by swearing, but logic and a correct schedule and program. I think it is shameful. If you believe in yourself and your party and don’t have any weakness, you should have a lot of thing to offer logically and you don’t come up short. You represent your fans and party and must always be prepared against your competitor(s)."

I am voting for a strong and viable military. I am voting for a vibrant economy. I am voting for the right to keep and bear arms. I am voting for the freedom to worship. I am voting for a national recognition of the founding of our nation on Biblical principles. I am voting for the ability for anyone to rise above their circumstances and become successful. I am voting for my children and grandchildren to be able to choose their own path in life, including how and where their children are educated. I am voting for our borders to be open to everyone who enters under our law and closed to everyone who would circumvent or ignore the law. I am voting for the Electoral College to remain in place, so that a few heavily populated liberal centers do not control the elections. I am voting for a Supreme Court that interprets the Constitution rather than rewrites it. I am voting to teach history, with all its warts, not erase it or revise it. I am voting for the sanctity of life from conception to birth and after. Let us all Make America Great Again."
1149,M Sreenivas,"My dear honourable citizens of America, please spare this ensuing presidential term for mr. Donald Trump and vote him back to power.  With his dynamism, wisdom coupled proportionally by convention and concurrence, his bold, daring and firm decisions, he can repress rogue regimes like the chinese, to establish world order, peace, security, prosperity to all global nations.  There are going to be innumerable elections in future and democrsts can try their hand during those.  If mr. Biden is voted to power, China will take upperhand and try to fulfil its misplaced and totally undeserving superpower aspirations. And soft ss the democrats generally are with mr. Biden being no exception,  America as well as other countries will again become vulnerablehave to the wolfwarrior's illegitimate and immoral territory grabbing and unprovoked bullying."

1159,ashleydeauna,Hilary told us EXACTLY who Mr. Orange is. I hate that he won the election.
1160,Louise Coleman,The Obama administration developed a pandemic crisis plan during his tenure as president. It was titled: “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents.” Trump made a conscious decision to ignore this plan. It's time Trump was held responsible for this wanton disregard for the health and safety of those Americans who have died as a result of his callous disregard.

1177,TheVCHorseguy,"Joe; Come on man. I've been in Congress for 47 years and haven't followed through on any of my promises. But that doesn't matter, I finally have a plan. No, really, I have a plan to fix everything. I will restore our standing in the world. I'll do this by selling out to the Chinese. I'll come groveling at the feet of the rightful masters of our world. I'll allow Corporations to take jobs away from Americans so Wall Street can finally get back to their financially catastrophes, To avoid any misunderstanding between us and China I will just turn over everything to the Chinese; no competition to keep Americans working. And don't forget my sh*thead son. He disgraced the reputation of this country by drug use in the Navy, but he's not responsible. We have attorneys that specialize in removing accountability. So see, Hunter didn't own up to any of his corrupt actions. He has a disease that possesses the part of the brain that doesn't listen. To prove it I have hired attorneys to find out about this disease and give it a name and list it as a disease and a disorder......I know my plans will devastate the middle class by kissing China's a*s, because I was right to allow the Chinese in cooperation with our mega corporations that will ensure China's human rights violations. So I'm telling you man that we can surrender everything to the Chinese and that will force them to become better rulers. See I do have a plan."

If you owned a business, you would know about all the taxes you pay in business and the cost of keeping employees on payroll. My hats off to any business man that can keep people employed. I will never vite for a persin that has been a lawyer ir a persin that has never owned or ran a business, Because they dont have a clue. Biden hasnt done anything good in 47 years. Kets go over Bidens income tax and ask questions to where he got the 15 million 2 years ago that he doesnt speak of. Get ready to not like Trump 4 more years.

1305,steve and sherilyn,"I am a British citizen from birth so have no emotion invested in either of these parties.  So as an outsider here are my thoughts about this so-called debate:  it reminded me of a satirical tv puppet show called “Spitting Image” which was one of the most watched shows on British television during the 1980’s and early 90’s.  If you never saw it I suggest you Google it and you will know what I mean.  Two men with important jobs, one who currently runs the USA with its economy and healthcare under his control, the other hoping to take that position, acting like spoiled children arguing in the schoolyard - he said this, no I didn’t, yes you did, didn’t, did, yes but you did that, no I didn’t, yes you did, didn’t, did, I’m really smart, no your not your a clown, your mum (or son in this cases) is a crook, no she isn’t, is, isn’t.  Out of the millions of professional people in the US and these two are running for Presidency? God help you!  Both of these “men” agreed to keep quiet for just two minutes to let the other one speak, that lasted about 3 minutes.  If they can’t have an adult debate and honour their agreement for more than 3 minutes without throwing their toys at one another why does any sane American think that they will keep their promises to the voters?  They are making a laughing stock out of you!  The whole thing was cringeworthy and embarrassing to watch.  I wonder what the founding fathers would say if they saw this."

Biden gets angry fast and snaps ignorant things to people if they ask hard questions and demand straight answers! The media doesn't  hold him to the same standards they do of Trump! All past Presidents did a really lousy job of handling pandemics! This was done to our country! It wasn't  his doing ,but he acted quickly and to give the States what they needed and let the States run their States! The States that have really done the worst was those States leaders mismanagement of the pandemic! HRC is one of the worst ,corrupt evil person on the face of the earth! Obama and HRC did the most treasonous things while in office! And you people know it! If MSM wouldn't  be complicit in her crimes and coverups hundred of thousands of children and woman would still be alive, instead of being sacrificed to their pocket books!

To be fair Joe kind of had his hands tied behind his back having to debate with this fool unless he wants to stoop to his level. Trump doesn’t care he can’t even behave himself for a presidential debate where there are actual rules they have to agree and abide by, but he just trampled all over everyone to make sure all the attention is on him. The Donald master of the universe or so he likes to think when in reality he’s the worst president of all time. So thankful I’m not American man and I used to dream about living in America but never have I been happier to be a Brit than this moment right now. I’ll pray for you all on nov 3rd and hope this time around I don’t wake up to Trump being re-elected. I still remember going to bed sure he would never ever in a million years win but I’m realising that the thought of a woman president was just to much for America to deal with. They could have made a historically momentous decision and shown that they really were forward thinking and truly cared about equality with the first female president and instead I woke up to slime ball reality tv star The Donald as the new President of the United States. I can’t help but wonder how all this madness is going to look 2120 lol they will think we are primitive fools. 🇺🇸✌️🇬🇧"

But instead, they stated they side before this guy had a chance to open his mouth. They keep pointing on politics but they are far worst with this trying to manipulate people crap. taking out of contest moments, cutting, montage for they own favor. I agree, politic is a big swamp, they care about themselves.
