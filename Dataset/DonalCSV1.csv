6,Bry B,"To the couple who lost their business: If more people like you actually cared for the people negatively affected by systemic racism, maybe the police would feel a need police differently. If the police were willing to look at their policies, then maybe fewer Americans would die needlessly at the hands of the police. And if fewer people needlessly died, there would be less, (for those who feel it) need to speak for the unrepresented."
7,maria cronin,I‚Äôm so embarrassed and scared for our nation

12,Ms Smortion,"""Never before have we heard a president delegitimise the most democratic election system in the world"".  Who are you people? ""...democratic election"".... you have to be kidding.  The USA is so corrupt, you buy and sell your politicians and the rest of the world just watches as your ""developed"" country goes backward on the social progress index.  The USA, along with Brazil and Hungary, are the only countries that have declined ranking in at 28th!!!!"
13,J Ramanathan,But he didn't  go down and kiss the people. All talk and alot of BS.
14,Dallas Nyberg,"I, for one, do not believe he had covid at all. I think he staged it to try to convince the public that it was nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, 227,000 dead American citizens might just conflict with his consensus."
15,Deomnibus Dubitandum,"‚ÄúThere is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ‚Äômy ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.‚Äô‚Äù ‚Äï Issac Asimov"

29,Barbara Brace,"This sounds bought and paid for: bias, any? Also sounds like a lot of opinion only with nothing, nothing backing up those opinions. Opinions are fine but that's all they are in the end. Objective research would be helpful. This is just more of the usual over-the-top, waste of time emotional rant."
30,April Drosos,Sure looks like it.  Now God is relevant now that the ship is sinking
31,Mr.Gamer10,He's cleaning house of all of the corrupt politicians that got comfortable fkn over the American People. That's why they switched to Joe.. Cuz he's as corrupt as they come

48,Aussie Taipan,And surely the US are smarter than electing a candidate who shows early signs of dementia
49,Todd Rohrlach,You should do a show on Tony Bobulinski story on the Bidens . His first hand knowledge is an eye opener.
50,rplato c,The liars who called him  treasonous now want to convince us that he unleashed covid on us too that is what our President has faced from the start! The liars are going to cry again!

Please reestablish the wonderful life of harmony they once knew! Amen!"
57,Bryan Machin,"This is all happening just like a lot of people predicted: when the economy stops working for regular people, we turn on each other based on race. Only its been made worse by the choice of so many voters to support someone who is completely in denial of his own racism, as well as the causes of racial tensions in the country."

61,John Johnson,"It‚Äôs unbelievable how Trumps presidency isn‚Äôt recognised for what it is!
He is a patriot and wants the best for the USA.
His style is easy to pick faults with, that said he is perhaps the last hope for democracy of the West.
ABC‚Äôs left communist reporting is so misled by the thinking that the world is fair. The world isn‚Äôt fair and countries are still trying to dominate others."

69,Ch_ Kh,It's all optics and showoffs from a reality TV show host who got elected by chance to be the president of the greatest nation in the world. Americans have come to learn about the importance and danger of the seat of the POTUS if it falls in the hands of people like the current president.
70,Alfie Jordan,Trump ' I'm immune I'm gonna give every one a great big kiss' ü§£ü§£
71,Ed Lewis,"Absolute insanity here, this man is nuts. But a democracy gets the government it deserves. The only businesses 'winning' are the liquor stores. Excellent production by our Aussie friends, thank you."
72,James Buam,This whole program is just a hit piece?
73,M 50,I'd like to know how many people have died of covid in the villages. Courtesy of Donald joke Trump.
74,Reel Unique,"Let‚Äôs be honest the polls that have been taken are media and special interest manipulated and have only been taken in certain areas and demographics to make Biden look like he‚Äôs the apparent winner. Forget Russia interference in the election, China is doing it by sitting on the chair of large media cooperations and banks while supplying them with money to get out their communist agenda."

84,David Hass,It's not his fault it's everywhere because of Carona. I am also jobless since March 20.
85,Irma Vera,These people in the village do not care about everyone else in the US. They are financially secure so they don't care!

97,MrFatcatscott,This is really unfortunate that people with education are outnumbered by those who are not.  It is appalling to see those less educated group of people armed with guns and calling themselves militia as if they were up for some crucial mission.  They are lacking capabilities to make sound decisions due to their stubbornness and limited mind.  It boils down to this; education is such a precious commodity.

105,"hey, its Michael again.",Will we ever get back to the media just reporting the news? The Walter Croncrite day's? Unbiased? A divided nation no matter who get's elected. Some media is for Mr. Biden and another outlet is for President Trump. Some on the left and some on the right of politic's.  Would not want to be a journalist in these times. Could lose my job.

116,Ginger Golden Allgire,"Very good broadcast. The different sides and yet showing the way of what we-ALL Americans-must deal with going forward to heal the country in the coming years. It will not be easy, nor short term. The bitterness and distrust, along with COVID-19 must go through the grieving process. We have to get through the election results, the anger that is certain to be there just as it was in 2016, and any issues around (hopefully) transition. We have been through an increasingly devastating war these last 4 years. With a trump win, it will begin to look like Syria. With a Biden win, it will take a lot of hard work by ALL Americans. Biden and the government can‚Äôt do it by themselves. It is going to take us to work out our differences peacefully, to recreate trust in people and our government, to come together to rebuild the cities torn apart by violence and to join together by open communication to make certain communities don‚Äôt have to erupt into violence because people‚Äôs voices are not being heard. We need to take some collective deep breaths during the next few months and hope we all return to sanity and deal with the issues most necessary; taking care of each other with no distinctions."

140,roland charriez,"The sad part is that Trump is the symptom and not the cause. Unfortunately, ""every"" media outlet has given him the platform to speak his mind, regardless of how idiotic. The man is a great marketer, he knows how to exploit it. Some news outlets seem to have been taken over by the people in the White House. As we all know this proproganda started before Trump. We can thank Roger Ailes for that. Trump is a showman/marketer and always will hawk his ""Brand"", which is all he cares about. Many conservatives has accepted the ""Koolaide"" and has sided with him, possibly to further there own agendas. I just wish US citizens would do their own investigating from different reputable sources, by viewing and reading about currents events that could effect them and not just from one source. "

Acknowledging our great front line doctors and the advancements we have made medically is a good thing. Telling people not to be afraid after pointing out that we have medicine and resources is not the equivalent of telling them to be foolish. It's pointing out that not every coronavirua case is an automatic death sentence (which is what many Americans still believe). Him saying to not be afraid is actually harmful to his campaign because some Americans that support him have lost loved ones."

326,Michael Lawrence,"I love 4 Corners as an institution of Australian journalism, but this was the worst episode I have ever seen by far. The whole thing was awful, but let me cut to the worst bit: Trump DID NOT refuse to condemn 'right wing militia groups'. There in fact were NO right-wing militia groups at all until Antifa/BLM had been murdering and viscously assaulting people and burning down entire city blocks for several months. Kyle Rittenhouse was not a member of any militia group; earlier that day he was administering first-aid to BLM protestors. He was accosted by a violent mop when he attempted to defend a local business against arson. If he hadn't shot the people accosting him, he may very well have been killed, and did well to defend himself against that. (Imagine, if you will, trying to beat up a 17year-old whose carrying a rifle. What good outcome are you hoping for?) I know these things for certain because I WATCHED THEM HAPPEN with my own eyes. I was frustrated with msm not covering the BLM riots AT ALL, so I watched them on livestream - hours of it - most of it filmed by the protestors themselves. The mop violence I saw was horrendous. I was watching a livestream when a BLM protestor said ""I don't think I can do this anymore"". He'd just seen a local service-station, staffed by two black women, nearly burned down and looted by his fellow protestors. Luckily the police showed up just in time and saved the women. All this has been completely ignored by major media sources in the most appalling way. When Trump talks about 'fake news', he's making a huge understatement. We now live in a time when the complete opposite of reality is often what's reported."

He has proven to be no better  informed then any one else yet he thinks he is important and tell the rest of us what to think and not giving us the facts to think about. They decide what we hear and it goes by the way of their clouded liens. They have never asked the important question of what is the roll of the press in a free democratic society? There is always some one willing to tell a king what he  thinks the king wants to hear but not the truth. Ours is collectively  called the press. The think that they know the people but run out and get their story then go back to their bar. Polls are an example of this. They spit out who is leading in the polls like an announcer at a race track, he's a head,   now he is behind. Only a fool would make as important decision on a poll. But that is so like them. There is one country who is trying to take over land of all their neighbors, control sea going traffic on  the open sea on one of the most important trade routs, interfere with every country who borders that seas, have a unit of their army monitor  all traffic on the internet, have a law that any one who produces computers or cell phones make them in such a way that they control and spy on any user, they have passed laws that make any thing that they consider an insult liable ti them no matter where they live. They have made predatory loans to small countries who could not possibly pay them back by building ports or offering to build ports or canals then taking them over, or demanding a navy base their. Do we hear any of this from the press? NO! Let some one in a far away country kill their girl friend they go on and on (as the blade runner).  Why do they want to support a foreign who has openly stated the wish to destroy us is beyond me. Don't they realize that they owe their existence to the first Amendment? Do they think that they will have the freedom if we do away with the Constitution? Are thy tiring to kill the goose who laid the golden egg? Did the country in Question give them money?

When people say it should be All Lives Matter when opposing BLM only exposes their bias and unacknowledged privalidge.... All lives do matter but at this present moment there's many instances of taped evidence proving black lives don't seem to matter as much as the rest of the country.... Literal murders if unarmed victims that have almost totally been unaccounted for entirely is a disgrace on the US, especially considering the centuries of diabolical AA history preceding these most recent atrocities... Has anything truly changed for the stolen race forcibly removed from their home nations, held as slaves, widely considered beneath and treated worse than subpar livestock to a present reality that's barely improved... Victims of an economic type slavery of mere existence, where crime flourishes attracting overwhelming levels of police activity, treating them with similar disdain to times past where there literal murder barely raises public outcry let alone being adequately dealt with as the crimes they are going 9 times out of ten having zero consequence for the beyond guilty murderers cause police! The end! They don't own a goddamned thing so why wouldn't they burn it all to the ground... Easy to start again when your business has been damaged not so easy when your killed for merely being present and black.... When all white people call for this injustice to stop, and agree policing needs reorganising federally then All Lives will indeed matter as AA will have been acknowledged to matter just as much.... Lastly imagine computer store owners were being summarily executed by police because of their choice of employment with no consequences despite many may repeated incidents of literal criminal behaviour by police ignored by the majority of society.... Would they still feel like all lives mattered if there's so obviously did not to the rest of the country... You should feel content that they are only pushing back in a very restrained manner considering the issue they're protesting against... Maybe focus on the polices usual heavy handed over reactive response to mostly silent protests using military grade hardware and tactics, one of the key issues they're there trying to change....

His automatic recession from several engagements USA made in the past years is creating a void that is to be filled with chaos, you can see Afagan. He overlooked the importance of exit plan without creating a shock and creating a globally disfigured image of his country.

Trump no longer has the appeal of an outsider, his faults (ESPECIALLY during this pandemic) have been on full display for 4 years, and he's running against a rather likeable and moderate opponent in Biden. Add in the fact that the turnout is very high, this election looks like a sweep by the left."

All things being tight  there opens the door to a contested election. Long ballot tabulations will enable trump to use that delay to enlist the courts.

Our army is the most powerful in the world, but under Obama as president, we have fallen into the hands of Iranian soldiers, our work in the US is transferred to China and there are many humiliating problems. more must be mentioned. under Obama and the ruling Democratic Party. Just three years after President Trump and the Republican Party, our country becomes a mighty and great country that the whole world must respect. When we travel abroad with US passports, we feel proud of our homeland. If Democrats lead the United States, when we buy a chicken, we have to bring a bag of money to buy the same socialist Venezuela. The Democrats of the United States want to take the American people down the socialist path of slavery to China and let China control Joe Biden and the Democrats bring the country down. I've never believed Democrats. The evidence is clear; Joe Biden and his son used the vice president to threaten the UKRAINE government because of his son and he split the corruption case. Joe biden and his son are Chinese with millions to over billions of dollars. If Joe Biden is elected president, our America will follow the path of socialism and Democrats will only obey China's directives. When our money goes abroad, we lose more money.Joe Biden is currently amnesia and is using his position to corrupt as the leader of several socialist countries."

If he didn't have Covid19 could he have had another less harmful flu strain and let everyone believe it was COVID19?  He recovered too quickly especially for his age and obesity to have had COVID19.  If so, why would he be doing this? Possibly an attempt to show his base he could recover quickly dispelling the suspicions of his less than perfect health?  At the same time he could gain sympathy while demonstrating the COVID19 is overblown thus covering up his incompetence in handling the pandemic."

I believe, He should be given another four years to Show what he would have done if this pandemic didn't happen. If Hillary Clinton had got into power how would the country be today? Would she have handled it differently? But Having said that I would add, Not one country, has been prepared for something like this virus. So people, be fair and not selfish in your Judgement.  If another Virus was to be released on us, being divided isn't going to help. Prayers for the world gone out."

867,Ranaldo Bobsled,United we stand but divided we are. America is in a very bad place right now and it's not all the fault of Trump. It's been going in the direction of division for decades and what we are living today is the failure of the  American government and people to do something about it. There are two answers to Americas division: 1) completely overhaul our government and constitution or 2) civil war. Unfortunately I believe civil war will prevail because the people are just too ignorant to understand the magnitude of of Americas problem.

And a line drawn with China that was desperately needed. Covid is a world problem and outcome at this point would likely not be much better in Democrat hands. The mainstream media is disgustingly bias and in the pocket of Democratic party and goes to show the doom and gloom. And will never show shortcomings out of there own. A vote for joe is a vote for the beginning of the end of our democracy as we know it. They know it. It will begin another massive string of scandals and sell out of anything we as Americans hold dear.

The reality is this virus is no more lethal than a cold or flu 150 and 180,000 people have died every year for the last how many decades? ...from cold and flu but none of them ever died from it they only died with it because it tipped them over they're already pre-existing medical conditions and any who died ""without"" a pre-existing condition necessarily had an underlying condition they didn't know about otherwise they wouldn't have died. Or their death was accelerated by the Fear and pandemonium alone and or by iatrogenic over medicalization as a result of the exaggerated medical response of this virus. There is no reason for it to be any more virulent than any other naturally emerging virus. Nature and evolution have viruses to not kill but instead to simply live off the host for long enough to replicate and spread it. The fact of this viruse's high contagiousness is a function of its low lethality as the two are inversely related logically and in fact. The test for the coronavirus is not even accurate and is not even meant to be in place for testing virus infections as per the words of its inventor itself claiming that it can amplify up virus fragments that happened to match already in the patient as a function of a pre-existing condition. All the pandemonium about the case rate is misplaced because cases do not equal deaths. Nobody sees this from a logical critical thinking perspective it's all just rush with the propaganda that started with those agencies who  have a stake in epidemics such as the WHO, biotech and the neuologists who's existence and identities rely on being authoritative about a subject they spent their lives studying but who are unable to stand back like a generalist biologist and see the big picture and put this into perspective in the way that statisticians are able to do but have no credence because they're not epidemiologists or virologists as"

His tax cuts may have spurred economic growth in what has been a continuation of the recovery from the GFC, but it was at the cost of also causing the growth of the national debt to surge. If it appeared to many Americans that the economy was performing well as a result of Trump's 'policies', they need to think of who is going to be paying the cost; they can see who it will be by looking around the dinner table at home-at their chil-dren. Their children and grandchildren will be paying the cost in the form of lower living standards than ordinary people have today, just as people of today are paying the cost in the form of lower living standards than their parents' and grandparents' generations enjoyed as the USA embarked, in 1981, on its disastrous fical path with the national debt growing much faster than the economy."

If you have witnessed any Trump rally or rally even without him present, you will see the fervor his and the party supporters.     I believe it is not Trump himself, but the party and cause he represents that is the draw and excitement.

Regardless of Trump or Biden, the Covid-19 virus will spread itself far and wide long before a vaccine is available. So please, keep those, who you feel need to be, indoors and locked down and the rest of us who made it through will just have to get on with life, with masks on, and keep America running as it needs to in order to continue to securing the life you enjoy in this country.

In 2016, Trump won the electoral college, not the popular vote. Whichever candidate receives the majority in a state, takes ALL of their electoral delegates (even if the candidate only beat their opponent by 1 or 2%). So, Trump won more states, not the voter turnout. The popular vote almost always projects the polls surveyed throughout the months preceding the final election. Hillary Clinton was always 2-5 points ahead of Donald Trump, and this was reflected in the 2016 popular vote. In the coming election, it is almost certain that the current poll numbers will be reflected (to some degree) once again in the popular vote. Does this outlaw the possibility of the polls being wrong? No, however highly unlikely. "

1454,J√ÑGARNA,The funny thing is it won‚Äôt matter in which direction you vote.. he will be re elected. Trump was elected for a reason by the same people who controls the dollar. He was elected to destroy America so the next president after him will clean up his mess and look like a hero. It‚Äôs like a movie

Even if the government can't be bi partisan, even if the news can't, we can try to be ourselves. Don't bully someone if they don't agree. I know the issues are very serious. But people are most important, even if to one person the other person's opinion doesn't make sense, we need to stick together as people, because we are the United States, the governemnt and the news just represent.

1476,Robert Dalton,"I am completely disgusted at the bias in this programme.The framing of the narrative and the lack of understanding of the diverse extent of Trump's popularity is mind blowing but to be expected by the ever increasing bias programming of the ABC.Looking forward to the ABC's constructed narratives being thrown back in their face like a fat cream pie come election .We are not the right, we are not the left,we are the educated and we are awake."

1479,Chrissy L,"Biden can't even make it through a campaign,  how can he finish 4 more yrs. If you want Harris as a president then vote for Biden. Screw feelings, it is about policy not personality. Just yesterday, Biden said he was running against George Bush Jr. Pelosi's plan is to get Biden elected and then pull the 25th amendment on him. Either way with Biden we are not going to fend well. Biden has done nothing in 47 yrs for the American people. Trump has done more than Biden did in 47 months, let alone 47 yrs. Scranton will probably go Trump. I have seen many people say Biden hasn't done sh** for their state."

1496,Socialism is a leech,"Most of the old industries may be struggling because the Democrats caused one distraction (hoax) and scandal and pointed blame etc.... one after another so Trump couldn;t get traction and do what he was elected to do and implement his business policies in full. From Russia Haox to impeachment etc... it was non stop with the aid of FBI, DOJ and big tech. Imagine if none of that happened. Imagine if he was able to make things better as he did anyway, before Covid. In the final anaylisis, the Democrats, by their distractions and such, caused the poor to stay poor and thereby hoping to get more votes in 2020. That's how the scam works. I have lifted the veil on the BS for myself, recently."

If my my mother, who is long gone, would have told me how great I was, would I be so foolish to believe that. A truly great President is one who is seen as such, even grudgingly, by those who disagree with  them."

1520,Brad Stoner,"Ok, that liberal democrat campaign lady for Biden said ""he didn't shut things down, he didn't encourage people to wear mask, etc."" These people are giving allot of credit to Trump. Do they really think anyone would have listened? The media would have accused him of fear mongering. Oh, and if he would have ""shut things down"" out of the gate, the economy would be hurting allot worse than it is now. It has been proven that some of the states that had the strictest lock-down policies saw spikes in Covid-19 the minute that they let up on it. I don't think thus virus is going to go anywhere anytime soon regardless if you lock everything down or not. China tells the world that they have it all under control because they want to portray themselves as being more advanced and better than everyone else, especially the US but in reality, they have cases there too but they censor the media to keep it quiet. This virus isn't going anywhere until we finally have a vaccine to stop it."
