113,Rustam Tashpulatov,"I am Canadian and have no stoke in this election. I am also a living, real person living in Alberta and I am not a troll. Thus, I believe I can be objective. I personally see a huge weakness with Biden because on many issues he is either intentionally lying or just has a wishful thinking.
For my example, I will use only two issues: Immigration and Energy. On immigration, he is promising on Day one to restore DACA and provide a path for citizenship for the undocumented alliens. However, he conveniently forgets that any changes to Immigration and Naturalization Act requires Congress approval and even among the moderate Democrats there is no appetite for another Amnesty. The last Amnesty was done by Reagan which is billions years ago in the election timeframe. However, with XX years the pool of the illegal immigrants have pretty much replenished. What is the guarantee that after another amnesty we shall not have more illegal immigrants coming here hoping to get another Amnesty down the road?"

150,Dave Higgs,Biden just copied what has happened in the UK on coronavirus.

290,George Guansing,"Donald Trump is showing that is a pathological liar and aways deviate from issues on the table and always blaming China for the covid 19 global pandemics of which is of Donald Trump's doing and the whole world knows it. The attitude of his non concern of the more than 200,000 American Citizen already dead and millions more on the dying list is not fit of an American President. Should Donald Trump be re-elected for another term as the American, President Donald Trump will surely proceed with his desire to make war with China to start the Third World War. Bear in mind the USA also has many enemies and China is also Super Power with Nuclear Arsenals and has a lot of friends. The Arrogant Attitude and Street Tug Mental Culture of Donald Trump is dragging down the USA down the drain of shame. An egoistic Donald Trump is only bringging the US and the World into desruction. Satan is actually in the form of Donald and Donald Trump is satan."

Trumps lack of action and blatant lies are responsible for the spread of this virus. Even the moderator calling him out on his lies. I don’t care for Biden but for some reason this is what people have chosen for presidential candidates. The less of two evils is Biden. Honestly, picking a president by which will be the least of two evils is not democracy. Greatest country in the world and this is what we are given"

Biden's long range plan is the confiscation of homes and private property as a part and portion of total a total government power take over.

883,Rustam Tashpulatov,"I am Canadian and have no stoke in this election. I am also a living, real person living in Alberta and I am not a troll. Thus, I believe I can be objective. I personally see a huge weakness with Biden because on many issues he is either intentionally lying or just has a wishful thinking.
For my example, I will use only two issues: Immigration and Energy. On immigration, he is promising on Day one to restore DACA and provide a path for citizenship for the undocumented alliens. However, he conveniently forgets that any changes to Immigration and Naturalization Act requires Congress approval and even among the moderate Democrats there is no appetite for another Amnesty. The last Amnesty was done by Reagan which is billions years ago in the election timeframe. However, with XX years the pool of the illegal immigrants have pretty much replenished. What is the guarantee that after another amnesty we shall not have more illegal immigrants coming here hoping to get another Amnesty down the road?"

Law enforcement and military force, which are supposed to be a service rendered to other people, should be the only service a government provides, as they are the minimum service required to uphold any rights. I do not have a right to have someone who breaks into my home tried before the law, that's just he best way we've ever figured out to try to uphold everyone's right as close to equally as we can. I do not have a right to someone else's time or property, I have a right that someone else will not take my time or property without my consent.

1499,Danielle F,ONLY CARES ABOUT THE RICH !!!! I’m home with my son out of school due to school and I get 54$ a week no help other than that !!! Does he care NOOOOOOOO !!!!! He cares about the rich !!!!! REMEMBER THAT
1500,Farsha 17,What is the point having a debate with no fact checker? They both just keep making points and both are lying at times with no reprecution

1506,Carol Ann Johnson,Trump only had the flue
1507,OEB KING,Why does Trump look so stressed
1508,Lynn S,"Better than the first debate!   Biden referred to his opponent as “this guy” and “this guy here” says a lot about his own character.  Why do people blame Trump for the state of the economy?  It was great before the pandemic hit, and it will be great again once this is over if Trump is president again."

1512,Shaizee Shows,I barely see people without masks anymore. Using covid as a reason to attack trump is wild. If people aren’t wearing masks that’s there own fault. Trump told the American people they should wear masks. Trump2020.
1513,Erin Griffith,biden 2020 train LETS GO BIDEN WOOOOOOHOOOOOO
1514,Adam Asher,Biden looks like he needs a Red Bull!!
1515,Atin aziz,Donald Trump' has not released his taxes. Public has a right to know nobody can be elected a president if taxes are not realized. Many countries did not elect the PM and President and many had to step down because they failed to declare their taxes. Our crateria to  elect a  President  he must be honest and declare his taxes.  I hope people understand.
1516,Ste,Trump victor.  Not on the first debate but this one.

1531,Llcoola,Trump2020 BLDM
1532,S,"And that's why Americans will vote for Trump over Biden i think. Biden is too much of a politician - He came across as very shady and politician like.

I'm sure both trump and biden told a few lies in this debate though."
1533,Peter Phillips,"They shouldnt rush the debate. If it has to be a marathon let it be. They are talking on behalf of 300 million plus people about seriouscpolicies. Answers cant be 30 seconds long, thats stupid."
1534,Adam sonic,I'm on Trump way better..

1540,Jane Li,"Biden said that he will make China obey the rules. But how did he gonna get a dictator who is supper good at doing all corrupted things under table to obey the rules? Biden only put an empty speech there. He does not have any plans, instead he and his family have already been corrupted by the Chinese communist party!"
1541,Amoy Hayles,Johnson and Johnson had to halt their study because someone got sick in the process of the study.
1542,Darrel Vela,Vote joe biden 2020
1543,Andreea Alexandru,Bidan is so cocky for no reason. He's trying to mock Trump but none is laughing. I think his staff is keep telling him he has big chance to win for some reason.
1544,Hanna Li,"Take a looking,Joe Biden's nose is not straight!
 Why he's nose is crooked?  
Answer: Thinking right with good heart and tell truth ,the nose just alike Donald Trump's nose."
1545,dani cali,"my prediction? trump will win again. biden comes off as too weak, and too sleepy. why can't the democrats pull together a really strong candidate?  how hard can it possibly be? not female, because the american public don't want that, but a white, 40 something, likeable man who is as confident as trump. again, how hard is it."
1546,Ai Sama,"I’m not American but damn trump got good points 
Hopes he wins 
The moderator she’s so wack"
1547,ирка иванова,Behind  Biden theirs is a good democratic group and he will think before the taking decisions . Trump is too impulsive for politic life
1548,Lilyann Wilson,Im voting mr.Donald Trump
1549,Edwin Dcosta,Need trump leave Biden in the jungle
1550,Andrew Henderson,"Here we go again.  The Russian super-hackers and the sinister Iranians seeking to reelect Trump again - seriously???? How stupid does Biden think everyone is?  This comes from Joe ""The Chinese Candidate"" Biden, with evidence from Hunter Biden's laptop linking him with nepotism in the Chinese Communist Party and an email implicating Joe himself.  It's like something off the Simpsons."

1557,TelscombeTerror,"Looking into Bidens black beady eyes when he speaks he’s worryingly vacant and should be in a retirement home, imagine him in charge of America’s nuclear weapons, he would wake up in the morning in a panic thinking Pearl Harbour just happened again and go DEFCON 1"
1558,Michael Bowker,Trump definitely won the debate
1559,Wolfy229,trump won it
1560,Karl Klawatsch,"Mr.Präsident Trump und Mr.Biden haben für einen Präsident der USA doch schon ein vortgeschritenes alter ich meine dazu das der vorhergegangen Präsident           Mr . Obama täglich Täglich  14 Stunden  und mehr gearbeitet hat 
Im weiteren sind beide kanditaten sehr Carismatisch und                   ich als nicht Amerikaner hätte Mr.Trump vorne gesehen jedoch das Team was Mr Biden um sich hat ist schon eine Ansage an die Spitze ."
1561,BARTOSZUK2011,Vote TRUMP !! Yes for TRUMP !  🇵🇱

1571,Shai Curtiss,They say wear a mask yet i still caught a cold wearing one?
1572,Jessica Daniels-Brown,She is f biased. Trump needs to ask to respond to Biden. She asks Joe to respond to it. She is friend with Obama and Hilary. I know she is going to be biased before I even watch this.
1573,joyouslife4all,Looks like Trump burned Biden completely.
1574,Dylan Cravea,Jesus😂 this is better then the first but this is still sad. Buuuuut trump just stated facts and Biden kept bringing back quotes right out of the first debate. And Donald wants to open everything up. Biden can’t really expect businesses to be able to pay for all the expenses to open back up under his guidelines.
1575,Ddot Norreh,How on earth could that man be responsible for life and death? He's not God.
