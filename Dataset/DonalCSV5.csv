0,Hey Sam Graham Cartoons,Many swing states still a toss-up! Make sure to VOTE! This could go EITHER way!
1,Lex Slate,The worst part about America's fascist meltdown is the horrific loss of life and the misery inflicted upon anyone that isn't a rich white sociopath. The second worst part is the whining.
2,TheFeldhamster,"""The socialism""?!? The US barely has a centrist party as even the Democrats would be considered right of center here in Europe. What socialism?"
3,Diego,"Erick: ""Im not popular and noone likes me.  It has to be facebook's fault because I'm rich and my daddy is the president."""

6,Courtney Garcia,He literally said he'd bang the gavel to end America. And the crowd cheers.
7,sgbobsg,The majority of Americans support the Democrats and their policies. The Republican gang is out of touch with real Americans and are lying and cheating to hang on to power.
8,muckymucks,"I heard a soy farmer being interviewed today and he said that Trump's trade war with China cost him $18,000 but that it eventually worked out. He was then asked if he took advantage of the farmers aid bill passed by the Congress and signed by Trump and he said he did. So, socialism seems to be working for these idiots but they're so stupid and myopic they fail to see that it's socialism. It's only socialism for brown and black people."
9,taxx man,"""To infinity is where I'm going. And maybe, even, a little bit further."""
10,Mark S,"did he say ""he won't bang Nancy with it?""

13,nick lu,"The thing most people aren't really talking about is, even if you get the virus and you are asymptomatic, as your immune system fights that virus off, there is a very very very small chance that virus could mutate and adapt, the more of us it infects and learns how to harm, the worse it's going to get.  Every person infected is another chance for the virus to become something more communicable or deadly. Preventing infection is the only way to decrease the odds of this occuring."
14,Renoir,I love how these guys want to ‚Äòend socialism‚Äô but have no problem claiming free medical care or living expenses while the rest of us rot.

27,The BizzMoneyB,‚ÄúSocial media biased AGAINST conservatives?!‚Äù  Facebook implemented an algorithm that heavily steered traffic away from liberal outlets and TO conservative outlets.  There‚Äôs data to back this up.
28,Marquita Willis,"I'm convinced that 45 never had Covid 19. You would think that, He just went along like playing a social media game.."
29,Alan Mundy,"American politician's references to socialism show that they know nothing about it. It is just a dog whistle to their ignorant supporters. I am not a socialist, but I do believe in social justice and a number of socialist ideas such as ...shock horror... medical care for all paid for out of general revenues. Isn't it interesting that the countries that are happiest are Scandinavian, where social policies are of the sort criticised by Republicans. BTW, Eric if Americans  can see through the bias of social media, why are you whinging about it - surely it doesn't matter ?"
30,Nick Paine,"This is my president!!

34,PRAZ CuRay,Why do Republicans sound like a bunch of Karen‚Äôs
35,Kegan Clark,"""I will kiss every man there and every woman there"" .... ugh, disgusting."
36,Dr. Mantis Toboggan,Has Trump told his millionth lie yet? We should all get a prize when he does. Hopefully it will be a new president.
37,Def Def,Did Eric‚Äôs parents share a womb? He‚Äôs looking a little ‚Äúundercooked‚Äù these days.
38,TK Wallace,"‚ÄúPeople are getting better. And you know you‚Äôre immune - I could jump right there. You see those men? I could kiss the men‚Äù (8:55-9:02).

To be precise, SCIENCE magazine published a study today stating that 90+% of COVID-19 survivors retain a high-enough antibody count to fight the virus for 5-7 months following the illness. So yes, it‚Äôs likely that if you caught the virus in April-June of this year, you‚Äôve got a 90% likelihood of still having immunity. However, that‚Äôs scheduled to run out in November-January, right amidst the winter holidays."
39,Traekas7!,"The word is ‚ÄúPutz‚Äù, a Yiddish word, meaning what u said, Seth.

Actually,... the Polls in 2016, WERE CORRECT. HRC won the popular vote. By 3Million more votes. The Electoral College, an obsolete part of our Voting Process, (allegedly extremely bribe-able), somehow most voted for T."
40,mph seti,"Maybe if the right wingers don't want to be ""censored"" or ""unliked"" on social media, they should stop spreading lies and hate.
In reality, social media giants like FB and Twitter enable right wing BS constantly. if trump was any other person, he'd have been banned from Twitter long ago, as one example."
41,indigoranch,"I voted early in Ohio today (and may I just say what a relief it is to have my vote for Biden cast). It took about an hour, there were loads of people there, and loads of people in line when I left. I'm so happy that early voting is breaking records and I truly hope it's a blue wave that they can't deny. üíô"
42,Sean Maloney,"I am so glad the ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù cleared up a big issue we are having out here in CA. Until today, none of us knew the rules. Sure, we were being careful, keeping distance between tables outside, and even converting parking spaces into outdoor seating at restaurants. Nobody I know was aware of or owned this special ‚Äúcontraption‚Äù that helps us eat through our masks. There were people at the restaurant today risking prison time by eating at a table without a mask over their mouths."
43,Bullet Magnet,My question: Why was Ron Johnson going off at Zuckerberg about something on Twitter?

Sure he's got lots of assets but it seems incredible to me that anyone who inherited so much should have any debt at all. If he'd of just stuck the money in a bank account and collected interest and didn't live a lavish lifestyle he'd probably have over a billion now with no debt whatever.

But everyone else, especially 'them brown folk', ""they just need to work harder in the system that we all share in.""

551,Rojas-messilia,"Already the social media companies have used the news cover from censoring Trump and hunter Biden to attack and deplatform many extremely established left (essentially MSM competitor class heavyweights, even UN security council invitee i.e. world's best of best type) journalists, particularly re the fight-back against the lithium coup they helped stage with Trump and Christofascists in Bolivia in 2019. This is ALWAYS the real target, same reason they pretended there really was a drug war (something Nixon aides came out later and  were explicit about the whole drug angle being a complete fabrication) - the left is always the real target. Next time you support a power grab by power centres keep this firmly in mind, every power grab by the power centre is hundreds of anti-war and anti-poverty news outlets taken out (Alex Jones was cover for his own weight class wherein hundreds of near powerless left outlets try to put out the good news, as Trump was cover for taking out his own weight class of leftist) and two miles walked down the path to the next big minced American youth pie."

1146,Morten Jensen,"I still wonder... how many american can use the words correct. Socialism and communism is thrown around, ... but that is not what the american politicians who argue for these models are talking about, as they keep saying. They are talking about as an example scandinavian countries, social democracies. Where everything is still based in capitalism, but where there is a deep understanding of equality and that broad shoulders carry the weight befitting those shoulders, because when they have a business they also gain from the system, when they dont have to pay to sick employees, they know that the employees can get healthcare and have a decent work/life balance so they function more effectivly at work. .... social democracy is about taking care of each other and help everybody raise up. ... not about taking away the want and need to create (as seen by the countries who have this system, they do very well, and are happy and very innovative) they just dont have to be scared and nervous all the time because they are only one paycheck away from being homeless and hungry. ...... but i doubt americans at large know this. ... even Education benefit from this system. But it seems to me, when we Saw. - ... before covid - american tourists, that except the Odd one out from texas you can spot a mile away, that republicans do not leave America. Thus they see no other systems and ways to build a society. But it seems that facts are something that have a difficult time coming to light in todays America. - it also seem like a race to the bottom, here it would be a disgrace with nothing to compare it to, if at an election a party or person just came after another person, instead of talking about their own politics and then let the voter decide which politics are the better choice. (In the end all want what is best for the country there is just a difference in oppinion about what that this entails) but the kind of election campaign we are seeing in America that would be totally unheard of. - same with a tvstation that only covers one side of the story, they have to be fair and report things that are, and not things they create in terms of fear and scaretactics. That would cause quite a stir if a network did that. ... this has the added benefit that people can disagree but bot to the point we see our friends and familiy in America experience. Where relationships are destroyed over politics. .... we all pray and hope things change for the better. Fingers crossed for the election."
